## Intro
It is now day three in Baltica for our heroes, and thanks to the meeting with Hinto, some questions are finally answered. Long ago a tribe of gnomes and a clan of halflings cut a deal with an unknown party from the Moors. One member of each race was responsible for keeping the peace in the Moors, to make sure that the souls of the passed could cross over properly to the other side. Once one of the chosen passed, the next one would be born. The last true descendent of the druma clan passed away in the same year Mohik, or as you know him, Meow, was found. The same dog that found him then lived on to an age well beyond the average of his species, until the massacre two years ago. During the ritual with Hinto it was revealed that one tarnished soul is the nexus of all the suffering and disturbance currently ravaging the Moors. That which is trapping the souls the material plane, is Meow's old dog, Woof. Now with a clear goal in mind, the heroes return to the Moors.

Have the local smith, Isawyn the green gnome, give this to Tarrok.
### Fight area
> As your climb to the top of the hill progresses, over the edge you can see the glimmering of the starry sky. The full moon, that which should have passed after last night, shines down so brightly that you can clearly see your surroundings. The usual rustling of the trees and bushes around you have intensified with the wind. Sometimes you feel as if something is looking at you, a bush twitches, a tree branch shakes. You tread on. As you reach the top there is a pit, overgrown with grass. Small white and yellow flowers decorate the land, as do large monolithic stones. Your eyes land on the center of it, where a small, rusty metal frame rests.
Perception check:
- on the metal frame: 
    - It seems to be the remains of an old crib
- on the flowers/surroundings 
    - Underneath the flowerbed golden strings run in a wide circle around the crib/frame, as you follow it along it seems to be in the following shape:

After a while, several creatures howling can be heard, as three creatures climb over the edge of the pits, they are howlers. Later in the fight (suggestions on when are on the combat pad).
