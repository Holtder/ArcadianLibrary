## Intro
The investigation at the Ringkeep was short but fruitful. The heroes learned that Umbra, aka Thindar Holstice uses special disposable cloaks to communicate with her peons. More importantly, it appears she was romantically involved with Hobbs and even had a daughter with him. On the first night of darkness Thindar and her daughter disappeared into the night. It became clear that poor Hobbs had no knowledge of this, and even though he kept this information secret from his Lords, it is clear that he is a victim in this scenario. The Lords of the Ringkeep ordered Hobbs to finally take a rest, as he seems to be overworking himself to compensate.
Following this, the Ringkeepers venture out to handle other important matters. Apparently Meow has some important questions about his past whose answers may prove useful in solving his current problem: he is losing his connection with the feywild. The Fey, a magical realm of nature and chaos, of trickery and love, is fickle. Some may sourcae their strength from its powers while others may burn in its intensity. On their way to Baltica, a storm grew, lighting crashing down all around, centering on the Ringkeepers. The horses start bucking wild als Tarrok is the first to fall off his horse. Lozano and Meow fall next. Then it happens. A loud crack occurs as lightning crashes down on the halfling. A white flash, then darkness.

## Intro - The dream

> Tarrok and Lozano, it's dark. As your eyes adjust you get a glimpse of your surroundings. You are looking down on a round tower with a flat roof. On it's side, decorations by windows of stained glass, stretching down below into the dark clouds beneath you. The entire roof of the tower is made of stained glass as well, a strong light shining from within. Your eyes sharpen and you see depicted a young man with dirty, silver hair. He is surrounded with trees and around him you see depictions the four elements. A blaze of fire, a gust of wind, a boulder of earth, and a torrent of water. The sky is dark, but decorated with many stars, more than you've ever seen, and a large moon in the middle. Shadows on the moon shape a face, looking down. Lozano, you recognize this as Groetus, the sealed god of the end times. As the two of you look at each other, you notice that you are floating. As you speak, no air exits your lungs, no words are spoken.
> 
> In the center of the glass ceiling stands Meow, looking around confused. Meow, from your perspective you see mostly the same, from the light of the moon, you cast a long shadow. From the shadow, voices are heard.
> 
> - The first voice speaks, "So you've finally decided to come back." it is the voice of a young man.
> - Two female voices call out at the same time "We always knew you would."
> - The fourth voice proclaims, "Guided by the actions of a demon"
> - The fifth voice remains silent.
> 
> All voices speak at once; "You may have been abandoned, just as you've abandoned your past, but we are here. Find us and you shall have power anew."
> 
> The first voice, the young man, speaks again: "Before you wake up, you must make a choice. The elements are yours for the taking, as they were intended long ago when the forest delivered its gift. Only one will guide you to us, and in turn we will guide you to your answers. Mahik Saria; which element will be your guide?
> 
> **
> 
> After you've spoken your words Meow, the light from the tower begins to dim, darkness returns to your eyes.
> 
> The first voice speaks again, "Little bird, fly back home to roost. Remember to stretch your wings first"
> 
> Lozano and Tarrok, you smell something odd, memories of poor Hilda in Deepstone return as you recognize the smell of burned flesh. You are back at the road where the lightning just struck, sky clear as day. Meow is lying on the ground, what do you do?
## Departure
The players head south and will reach their first crossroads. Along the water goes the *Lakeroad,* to the west the *Coastway.*
Continuing on south, the players will reach the first river, one that they need to cross. They can choose to swim (water combat) or to continue along the road towards Teroll Bridge.
Water Encounter
Four River drakes (B3-107) - HP 34

## Teroll Bridge 
A small guardhouse is built alongside the bridge and a gate closes off the bridge. Two Troll Brutes (MC-227) defend the bridge and require money (500gp) or to solve three riddles:
- I have a tail, and I have a head, but i have no body. I am NOT a snake. What am I? 
    - A Coin
- What five long word become shorter when you add two letters? 
    - Short
- What belongs to you, but other people use it more than you do? 
    - Your name
> Zoljin and Erasto
## Eastward
Either after crossing the bridge or the river, the players will head east along the Nereidisha. They will see a cart coming along, the card is a typical gypsy cart, with a tanned man sitting in front, leading the two oxen forward as his wife is singing a song.
> Aahmes (M) and Anku (F) of the Snake tribe, fleeing their tribe after the birth of their son, the seek help to lift their sons curse. Wherever they go, bad omens appear. It's not that actually anything bad happens, but the omens are enough to be outcasts. They haven't named him yet until the curse is removed, but are open for suggestions.
> 
> (reminder, other tribes are Bear, Wolf, Eagle and Owl)
Stay the night with them as you set up camp. Make up some bad omens.
## Crossroads
At the end of the Lakeroad lies a t junction, the road is named the *Lightroad.* It runs from Baltica southward along Vandamere towards Roughton.
## Northward
Music: stressful, make them run for it.
A storm is brewing, rain is coming down hard. Lighting strikes the earth a few meters beside the players, have the players run toward Baltica. Have the session end on Meow being struck by lightning and being close to death.
Start next session with the first twenty minutes without Meow before he wakes up.
