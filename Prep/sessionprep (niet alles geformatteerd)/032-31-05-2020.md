## Intro
> Once returned from their endeavors in the time-warped labyrinth that is the mother tree, the Ringkeepers were immediately forced to make a choice. Save their new friend Taegen Torzeiro from the clutches of the Nightmare Court or find and save Tarroks long lost sister Scara from Ra'adok, the mad merchant? The group chose to do the latter, and hatched a plan. Together with Brandir the heroes decided to enter Ra'adok's camp guised as a group of Ketephys devotees. As a tithe, a chest of gold was provided. Little did the people of the encampment know that this chest was part of a heist to get Scara out of the merchants clutches. During the execution of the heist however, not everything went according to plan. Due to a teleportation mishap, Meow and Tesh created a ruckus at the encampment vault. Scara became suspicious and tied Lozano and Tarrok up against a tree. A cart filled to the brim with fireworks suddenly exploded and chaos ensued. After a tense exchange Scara bolted off into the darkness with Brandir in close pursuit.
> 
> A slightly charred and furious Ra'dock emerged from the camp. Eyes burning fiercely, hands shaking. We are now continuing where we left of previously, a skirmish between Ra'dok, Lozano and Tarrok, with Meow and Tesh approaching from behind.
> 
> A heavy rainfall begins, Ra'dok looks at you, "Once again" WHY, DID, YOU, DO THIS. Did Saul send you?
##### Encounter:
[https://shmeppy.com/game/1926266728](https://shmeppy.com/game/1926266728)
- Spell hunter (npc codex 83)
- Pauldrons 
    - cursed, when you put them on you have to make a will save in order to not have your mind maddenned by the entombed spirit. This spirit is Ilmendil, the daughter of the Alion blacksmith in Thieves End.
    - Once every three rounds spawns a lion shade: HP 10, Lion bite attack+10 3d6+2
- Init is: 
    - Raadok 
        - Any spawned lions
    - Meow
    - Tarrok
    - Lozano
### After the fight
- Brandir was wounded, but alive. He wasn't able to catch Scara 
    - She was fast in a way he had never seen before, running without being hindered by the forest while he was obstructed every step.
##### Interrogation Ra'dok:
Ra'dok is stubborn and won't talk without a deal or when properly pressured. Information he can divulge. Ra'dol is not aware of the relation between Scara and Tarrok, he just thinks they want his seat on the Five Pronged Star.
Information he has:
- Scara 
    - No idea who Tarok is, never mentioned him
    - He took her in as he saw a prodigy in her
    - Didn't do the head on a spike thing, maybe look at your little nightshade friend for that one. (See interrogation Brandir)
- Five pronged star. 
    - Notable members (inluding nicknames): 
        - Brute: Ra'dock
        - Key: Clegg Zincher (Saul Vancasterkin)
        - Jaws
        - Blade
        - Keelhaul
    - In the Arcadian Network, there are five influential merchants that have worked together to influence the land to their liking. They counteract the working of the nightshade guild trough trickery and hate.
    - He will say "You know what, you already failed. Even if you plan to take my seat after killing me, Scara will probably have done so already instead." 
        - If he finds out Scara was the one behind the explosion, he'll be angry and humored at the same time. He trained her well apparently.
- Pauldrons 
    - Spent weeks bartering for the stupid pauldrons, no side would say if they had it. Legends say it could once end the war. 
        - So we kept offering both parties, give it to us, we'll use it to kill the other guys, but no one gave in.
        - Turns out both parties didn't have the damn pair. It was buried somewhere in some catacombs, where a few bribed molekin found it for him.
    - Turns out they're cursed. Radok got away relatively well, as his mind wasn't altered by putting it on, but taking it off will kill him. His next step was to find Alion to have him remove it and then kill him. 
        - The lion inside needs to kill one creature each day to be sated before it starts to feed on the mind of the wearer.
        - Putting it on means fusing the lions spirit to your own and is an ordeal on its own. It can leave someone's soul permanently scarred
    - Apparently its curse is a public secret, everyone knew about it but no-one spoke about it. It is why no one used it before.
#### Interrogation Brandir
- Yes, the head on the spike was placed on the spike by a member of the Nightshade guild
- Brandir did not know this at the time, these were machinations by the Mailman
- He nearly quit when he found out. Only reason he stayed was because this whole plan was because the mailman had plans with Tarok, and Brandir would rather be by his side than to throw him to the wolves.
- Was relieved when the mailman died, supposedly freedom for Tarok. Turns out it was all part of the plan, other members apparently dropped rumors of the pauldrons at Ra'doks doorstep.
- Five pronged star: 
    - Founded by one member codenamed Key, know other codenames as well.
    - Just as the mailman is undying, so it Key, at war for ages.
### Thieves End
##### Alion
- Is glad and sad to see the pauldrons but sad to hear what happened to it.
- Explains the curse of the item. Ilmendil's soul is inside it.
- Asks the players to return the day after for their reward.
- Next morning a group of Arcadian guards will slam the Inn room door: 
    - Someone heard a gutteral scream from the house, when the guard busted the door down, they found Alion, sitting in a chair, drooling. Wearing odd, black pauldrons.
    - There was a note beside him, meant for the Ringkeepers, players are expected to go to the town hall as the Mayor is in possession of it.
##### Mayor
A female human seemingly in her 50's, scar along her forehead. Grey long hair in a bun, rapier on her hip and a large tome on the other side. No nonsense type of woman, has fought to protect Thieves End and is sad to see Alion die, but is glad to see intruders have died. The players can see she is telling stuff a bit as a matter of fact.
> Take a seat. I have news for you that you might consider distressing. Alion, the blacksmith, has more or less died tonight. I gather you saw him yesterday just before returning to your lodgings. I'm sure this must feel rather sudden, you have my symphaties. Before he went he wrote two notes, one addressed to me, explaining the situation, and the one I will read to you now.
> Dear Ringkeepers and allies,
> 
> It is with deep regret that I must inform you of my passing. To say I have spent the night crafting your reward would be a truth and a lie all the same. My night was spent trying to free Ilmendil from my cursed creation. Now that I have realized how, I also know my fate, my penance. The curse that plagues my dear daughter is one of isolation, one of lonelyness. What remains of Ilmendil is broken, a soul unloved. Cursed with a hunger that can only be sated with the soul of one that loves her.
> 
> My soul.
> 
> This is my burden to bear and my debt to repay. I repay it kindly and with love. However, free of debt I am not; as I have eternal gratitude to you for finally giving me the chance to end my guilt. Once I put these pauldrons on, my soul shall be consumed, I shall not resist this. Ilmendil will find nothing but love for her and hopefully rest will return to both our souls.
> 
> What remains of the pauldrons will be a force to be reckoned with, prehaps it will not be as strong as when I crafted it, but I hope it will be of great support during your travels.
> 
> Whatever happens during your future endeavors, remember this from an old man. Love is never lost, only forgotten, especially within family.
> 
> With the kindest of regards,
> 
> Alion
> 
> PS: Tarok, I know you will find her, just as you have found my daughter.
