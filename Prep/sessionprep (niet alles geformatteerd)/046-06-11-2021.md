## Intro
Play: Drytop
It has been a while since we delved into the story of Meow, Lozano and Thaddeus. Our three intrepid heroes have been on the chase, hunting down the members of a dark organization named Ouroboros. While their motivations are yet unknown, their actions betray evil intent. First they laid siege on the Ringkeep, darkening the night sky until no stars were left to be seen. Umbra revealed herself with the mighty demon AgadÃ»l as her lackey. The heroes were able to prevent them from taking the castle, but at a cost. After the fight, Lady Fightmount was nowhere to be seen. Fortunately, not all was lost as she left behind important breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs, that led to essential information, such as the fact that this night was the first of five, five nights of darkness, unannounced and unyielding. In order to avert a foul fate the heroes need to withstand the horrors each of these nights. The second night came a few months after, when Umbra solicited the help of several hags to attack Felbrook. For some reason Umbra and her cult wished to capture the remains of Captain Wilhelm and the ritual site in which he was being revived. The fight that followed was long and fierce, but again the heroes emanated victoriously. Afterwards our heroes welcomed Wilhelm Brightrun back into the fold, as they informed him of their recent travels. Additionally they told him something even the captain did not expect them to find out, the true identity of Umbra. Hailing from the Ringkeep as wel, Thindar Holstice. The local herbalist and old flame of Hobbs, left with their newborn daughter Maria soon after her birth. What this all means in the long run is still unknown; unfortunately this is where the trail went cold, and Meow, Lozano and Tarrok went off together to fight more personal battles. Somewhere in this chapter of the story, we had to say goodbye to Tarrok as he left this world for the next one. Not long after we welcomed Thaddeus in our midst, and without a good chance to recover, a new clue emerged!
Close to the northern border of the Arcadian Mainland lies a fierce fort, Castle Ulfgrim. Lord Hirm Graham and his court rule the local lands and are not known to interact much with the surrounding lordships and fiefdoms. A silence that is gladly reciprocated, as working with Lord Graham is known not to bring good fortune. You have received a letter from this very lord inviting you to dine at his court, to celebrate your recent victories. Additionally, he may have some information for you regarding a certain individual you have recently lost. Without much delay you set off in one of the carriages of the Ringkeep, with Hakim as your coach. The past two days have been uneventful, but as you enter the lands of Ulfgrim the sky turns a cloudy grey, as soft rain drips down and muddies the road. The horses trek on through the difficult land, and the rain only increases. On the third day, rain pouring so loudly on the wooden roof of the carriage that you can hardly hear anything else, the sound of knocking breaks through the cacaphony, coming from the front of the cart.
## Session Summary
This session is before lord Hirm has returned and gives the players a chance to get to know Ulfloch. Ouroboros has taken residence in the Ulfloch catacombs and are planning to perform a soulbinding ritual to transfer the evil spirit of Umbra to Lady Fightmount's body. Graham is aware of this and hopes the heroes will take care of this problem. There lies a dark secret in the Lord's predecessors that is tied to Umbra and her past. During the first session, it must appear that Graham is the enemy. He is a dark wizard and a vampire, but currently his goals align with the ringkeepers.
## Arc Summary
It turns out Thindar is not Umbra, her daughter, Maria, is the reincarnation of Umbra, Lady Dusseaux. The baby has put a spell on Thindar, controlling her from her baby body. Lord Hirm Graham is a far descendent of Lady Dusseaux and, in his own attempts of reaching immortality like his predecessors, started to dabble in the dark arts himself. While not a saint himself, wishes to help the Ringkeepers find her as he has been harassed by the cult of Ouroboros for a while now.  
  
Lady Fightmount is in a dungeon underneath the Ulfloch, an old area that once was the headquarters for Lord and Lady Dusseaux. In here a ritual will be taking place for Umbra to possess Fightmount, as she could use a more powerful host than the herbalist Thindar.  
  
The players will have to endure the difficulties of the court before gathering enough information to reveal the locations of Umbra's base. A puzzle outside the lake to reveal the entrance. A difficult and long dungeon to lead to the entrance. At the end the ritual will take place. The plot twist will be that Thindar is innocent and the baby is evil, whether they succeed or not decided with which host the baby will leave.  
  
During this arc players may find out about the Dusseaux family and their original lordship. Their evil background and the identity of Lord Duseaux is revealed in a later arc.
## Start of session
Read intro, play drytop as background music. The players are alarmed by Hakim that a second carriage is arriving. Hakim does not recognize the coach. If pressed (or if the players perform a succesful perception check), it will be revealed that the hooded driver has green skin. It will turn out this is Wilhelm, recently turned by the resurrection ritual into a dryad, in his cart are Tesh and Argentus Blakely, both under an illusion spell to look human. Tesh looks like a halfling with dirty grey and flat hair, whereas Argentus looks like a suave nobleman. They'll get a chance to reconvene, as the inside of the cart is larger on the inside. It is large enough to house everyone including the other cart and is decorated like a persian tent.
They travel on together until they reach Ulfloch, the village and lake by the same name.
## Intermezzo: Fight with the Vampire Hunters
> Screams can be heard from the outside, "Oh gods he's dead, he killed him!". As you run outside you see three dwarven men, all three dark brown dirty hair with a matching beard, these three are obviously family. All three in leather tunics with a broadly rimmed hat that hangs over the eyes. One of the three just stabbed a merchant who was selling his wares on the market. His wife crying from a safe distance. The man with the bloodied blade yells out "ANYONE AND EVERYONE COULD BE ONE OF THEM, THEY TOOK ONE OF US, NOW WE TAKE ALL OF THEM!"
These three brothers are of a family of dwarven vampire hunters on the trail of Lord Graham, intending to kill him during one of his hunts they got captured and hypnotized into thinking that the Lord in is disguise amongst the villagers. They also believe that anyone could be a vampire despite it being in the middle of the day. Apparently there was a fourth brother who was killed during this fight. They'll fight anyone tooth and nail. If only one is left and the players try to detain him, he'll try to kill himself.

## Ulfloch Castle
If the players are going to the castle despite the young lord's absence, they'll be met with Varesh Gordo, who'll give them a small tour through the castle. During the tour the players will hear faint organ music through the walls, seemingly coming from every direction. This organ is located in the Lords secret chambers and is playing songs on repeat. The tubes that come out of the organ run through the castle walls, forcing everyone in the castle to listen to it.
If the lord has already returned, create a tense setting during dinner where the players will be presented with multiple riddles during conversation.
In the end the Lord will offer them information at a certain cost, a favor. This favor can be called in whenever he wishes and the heroes must comply. Lord Graham will ensure that this favor will be in line with the goals which the heroes have at that point of time, but they can not know what it is beforehand. It is a sign of trust, as this information may be the end of the Lordship. Give the final riddle with the players as they end their dinner. Make some things seem offputting like a darkred wine, but there is actually nothing wrong with this fine meal.
Maybe mention Lord Rumford of the Archways, who is a fief of Ulfloch.
