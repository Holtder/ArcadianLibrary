## Intro
Music : Fable II - Marcus Memorial
It was a long time coming, the second night of darkness. As Wilhelms ritual was progressing, so was Ouroboros' grasp on Felbrook. You three, accompanied by Toshio and Ash'er, ventured down to Felbrook from Pendlegast Peaks to find the source of the dark storm that was brewing in the distance. Within the dark clouds of the storm, a soul eater was growing. A band of Ogres and Hags were performing a foul ritual that fed this creature the souls of the incapacitated inhabitants of Felbrook. Realising the pressure of time weighing down upon them, the ringkeepers decided to engage the Hag leading the Ogres. The ensuing fight was dire, as we nearly lost our feathery friend Lozano. In the end it was Meow who delivered the final blow. With a spark in his eyes Meow N'one shoots out three magical bolts right through the hag, causing her to collapse and crumble.
The ritual is broken, and the soul eater in the sky flies off, straight into the woods, as two blood-curdling screams can be heard from the forest. After a few moments of birds flying away in a panic, silence overtakes the town. The tree in the center of the stone slab opens, and within a clump of green mucus, captain Wilhem Brightrun drops to the ground, seemingly unchanged, but alive.
Thindar Holstice, or Umbra, was close to getting her victory here, but despite her defeat, she got away once again. With no leads to go on, what will the Ringkeepers do now?
As the clouds disperse you see the setting sun disappearing behind the Pendlegast Peaks, a red hue colors the night sky as a cool summers shadow falls over you. It's been a long day and your sore muscles are begging you to take a rest.
Meow, make a fortitude save.

        - The most damage done to the town is metaphysical, its ties to the Fey are severely damaged and will take time to be repaired.
    - Ringkeepers, a toast:
> Hierophant:
> 
> (You see the Hierophant standing up, addressing everyone in the room)
> 
> When Pendlegast the First ascended these mountains and saw the peace that our little cove offered in this volatile world, even he couldn't have known that we would grow as strong as we are today. He decided our purpose would be to care for those passing through, as they make their way along the road of life. Over time we grew the constitution that allows us to carry the burden of others, if only just for a day or two. Tough and fierce as the storm we may be, mostly we are calm, as the pond within the forest, only rippling when disturbed. And disturbed we were, with the appearance of the cursed water temple, and then later with the invasion of the hags. The ripples will be present for years to come, as we need to learn to live with the consequences of the events of today.
> 
> The present is shaped by the past, unmoving as it is, and the future is nothing more than the everchanging, chaotic outcome of the choices we make today. That is why it is paramount to remember the choices we make, if we are to learn from our mistakes, otherwise the onces that have fallen will have fallen for naught.
> 
> (The Hierophant now focuses on you three)
> 
> The choices that we will remember from today are not ones we made ourselves, but ones made by our honored guests, the Ringkeepers. Three gentlemen that represent the reason why our dogmas are based around hospitality, for what is a life in this world if there is no one to share it with, no one to help when they are in trouble. Lozano the Nimble, Tarrok the Unseen, Meow the Volatile, if I do not speak for the circle of the Heiron, then I speak for the entirety of Fel'Boorak, we thank you.

- Drinking competition with Wild Boar
- Toshio and Lura will announce their intention to travel together (even have an actual fade to black at the end of the night with Tarrok)
