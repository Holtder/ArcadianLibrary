# Introduction
The rot of corruption in Oph is as ever present as it's starless night sky. Not long after closing the case of Woof, you run into new troubles, as you found the desecrated body of Mortar. Which is odd, as one would expect his soul to either evaporate to a higher plane, or to be turned into soulstones. Yet this body was different, it remained after death, it was dessicated and spread along the wall. The only body part not present was his heart, in its stead you found a small stack of soulstones. It took some intensive detectivework, but your investigationwork took you deep into the Pits, where you found a demon named Gutsnarl, who was specialized in splicing. You see, the most desperate of souls sell parts of their body to convert them into soulstones. Splicing is a secret and foul technique that uses a fragment of that cash and turns it into demonic body parts to replace them. Diluting what once made the souls complete. Mortar was special in two ways. First off, he was brought in by a man who turns out to be Alan Farthing, a public prosecutor of Oph, who was interested to learn about splicing. Secondly, the bodyparts that were made for Mortar were that of a shapeshifting demon, causing it to look like Mortar's original body, covering up any evidence.
Now, you have returned to the foul cathedral, and you have to make a choice, follow up on the lead that is Alan Farthing, and see if you can find him at the District Attorney's office, located in the Courthouse? Or will you be looking for freedom first, by participating at the Blood Bowl.
Whatever you do, make a decision fast, because when you look up towards a starless sky, you never know what entities may be looking back.
# Lay out
- Resume taking account of all the facts
- Both the bloodbowl and the courthouse are found in the inner city, Lasscapale (manhattan = man hat tan -&gt; lass, cap, pale)
- Lasscapale is surrounded by wall street, there are only two ways in, "if you know a guy" or by subway.
- Basically have the subway get highjacked by the Horde, the subway consists of four carts, the foremost of which has a captain behind the weel.
- Close quarters combat. Each five rounds new demons get in, the goal is to get to the first wagon. The wagons can be detached.
