# Intro
> It has been a hard past few years. Fight after fight, after fight, you've fought. All of you had been taken out before, a bad blow to the skull, maybe a spell or curse that took your consciousness for a moment. That all is thoroughly familiar to you. This however, is different. As the crystal shards pierce your skin, rupture your arteries, crack your bones, you all slump to the ground. The cacaphony of bodies, no, corpses thumping as they limply drop to the floor confirms it. You've failed. Shouting in the distance can be heard but they are of no concern to you, none of them are. You lie on your back and look up, unable to muster up the strength to focus your eyes. How nice it would have been to have seen the stars one last time. Clouds obfuscate the night sky as your sight darkens.
> 
> The light goes out. The sounds dampen. You feel each others presence. You feel all of you heading off. Thaddeus, you feel your essence being drawn into the ground, as you return what you have borrowed from nature, from the the cycle. Roots wait expectantly to draw in your nutrients, your fluids, your energy. As the the world diminishes, your peace grows. Lozano, the hunt calls for you, a deep and dense forest is expecting you. You know you are going there alone, you feel that Aloy will one day join you when her time comes. Meow, you feel the breeze past your cheeks, the winds carry the words of your family, they call for you, wherever they are.
> 
> You all drift apart in different directions. You feel the end and the beginning of something new. It was untimely, your death, but you are at peace, you are all right, you are going home.
> 
> [Evil laugh, Agadûl's voice:] No; not now, not ever, you are heroes are you not? You slay dragons, save the trapped, you slay tyrants. Well, now you are mine and mine alone, and I have one specific Tyrant in mind you may slay.
> 
> Darkness takes not only sight and sound, but soul as well. All goes dark.

> Lozano. You hear the sound of raindrops dripping against the wall. You've been here for a time now, hours, days, you do not know. Slumped against the cement wall, you feel the cold, hard stone. You look at the ground, cement flooring, at the side two metal beds stand are positioned near wall. Along the top edge of the wall is a small opening lined with metal bars. To your left are more metal bars, seperating your room from the corridor. along the corridor are more cells like yours. You hear a soft humming coming from above. A thick, glass ball hangs from the ceiling, within it you see a soft, orange source of light. In the cell across from yours you see a familiar face, a man, short of stature, leaning against a wall, just like you. You see him staring blankly ahead, just like you. Suddenly, you feel a hot pain singe your [xx], then a hot burning sensation on the back of your hand, you snap awake. Your sense of self returns, you hear a sizzle, the smell of burning flesh reaches your nostrils. The pain goes away but you remain awake. Meow seems to have awoken from his trance as well, you look eachother in the eyes. One look is enough. "Whatever is happening, we are in big trouble."
# Letter to Tarrok
> Alright Bane you know I'm not one for words. I've mentioned the presence of your old compatriots in this realm right? Well I got a new lead on them and I feel like I still owe you for that stint at the Foul. They just caught two new souls just kind of wandering on the road stuck in some sort of trance or I don´t know what. I've been told they are property of Agadûl, but the cops are putting secretly them up for auction, probably intending to sublet them as slaves until the big guy finally returns to the city. A little skeleton birdy told me they're being kept at Lurch Station, if you wanna get them you're hafta gonna move fast.

> Now we're even.

Additional lore notes about the city;
- It is inspired by 1920s new york, instead of an alcohol prohibition there is a strict rule against chaotic and senseless actions, however the system of law, politics and law enforcement are all corrupted beyond saving.
- Souls can either be redeemed and go to another plane or get crumbled by the pressure of the abyss, they turn into disc like pebbles called soulstones, the currency of the abyss.
