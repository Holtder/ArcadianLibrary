## Main
The players arrive at the grey spire and go to Jaina Fightmounts offices where Jaina is looking out of a window. She chastises the party for whatever happened. She doesn't want to talk about anything until Wilhelm arrives but does tell the following when queried: All over the land magic seems to be erupting. Not just demonic but all types, arcane, fey and celestial alike. Tiressea is in disarray and all contact was lost. At the same time, all Ouroboros cells that were being watched by the guard have lit up with activity. This is when Wilhelm Brightrum comes in and wants the players to explain what happened.

The two have a mission for the ringkeepers. To the north of Arcadia is a medium sized elven village called Felbrook next to the sea. Felbrook features a large statue of Gozreh which is sacred to the local elves. Last night members of Ouroboros have broken into the inner chambers of the statue and raided it. An Arcadian investigation squad is already at the location to check it out, but they need people who are intimate with the cult. Travel can be done one way by teleport.

(Also, felbrook is acqually named Fel'Boorak, but outsiders have been calling it felbrook)

The village has the following important NPCs:

- Druids 
    - Circle - all elves 
        - Male - Hierophant (both the leaders title and name)
        - Female- Bird
        - Male - Boar
        - Female - Bear
        - Female - Bee
    - Treetenders (all buildings are made of trees and need tending, treetending is a sacred position only given to women and all are given the title Fel) 
        - Fel'ora
        - Fel'pe
        - Fel'laru
- Arcadian reps 
    - Main representative 
        - Female Tiefling - Ally (Alloradofarah)
        - On of the few places she isn't shunned by the locals due to her looks - she's heard it all, beast, horned devil, succubus, fiend or her favourite, she-devil.
    - Leader of the guard 
        - Male Human - Chris Boruff, but most people call him Borf.
    - Dwarven Investigation Team 
        - Male - Furst Horncaller
        - Male - Ellgoth Boneheart
        - Female - Welilyn Axesunder

The statue looks like a gigantic elven woman crouching with hands in her lap. On top of her hand is a large leaf with one single waterdrop. The statue apparently has the bottom hollowed out a temple. These two floors have been completely disheveled and cleared. One secret lever opens the door to the third floor. Once the players trigger something there, the statue will sink and slowly fill with water, killing the investigation team. The players are faced with a race against time while running to the top of the statue, while at the same time uncovering the secrets of the temple and the darkness it features.

Note: the statue was built before the elves came and is internally structured like a human-built temple, not an elven one. During the night of the raid EVERYTHING was taken except for the contents of the hierophants room due to a magical barrier. Damage implies they've tried to get in though. Everyone was gone because of a ritual that took place during full moon a few miles out of town.

## Layout
### Floor 1
##### Room A:
Main room, built like a human temple room but used for meditating and sleeping for travelers and beggars.
##### Room B/C:
Private quarters for the hierophant. Features dirt, wood and a small, freshwater brook that seems to come out of nowhere. Next room has a fancy bed.
##### Room D/E:
Kitchen and storage: a professional halfling cook works here seven days a week.
##### Room F:
Library, completely destroyed and burned. Ouroboros logo scratched everywhere.
### Floor 2
##### Room B:
sleeping quarters for the druids
##### Room C/D: 
Storage area for relics, completely ransacked, nothing left.
The northern wall is hollow and can be broken through to the next floor where a stairwell awaits.
### Floor 3
##### Room A:
Western door is visible southern door is magically hidden. As soon as the playes open any of the doors in the room a loud bang can be heard from room D and the whole statue will sink. The floors below will flood and anyone in them will die. This is not caused by the players but the mechanism was broken during the raid and only now gave in.
##### Room B: 
A room filled with several statues of naga and other aquatic creatures. One statue of a lunar naga unpetrifies as the players enter the room. Fighty B3-197. After the fight another statue depetrifies and shows a Nixie (B3-201) who seems to be terrified of the players and flees into the next room.
##### Room C: 
Here the players will find the Nixie, called Tesh. She cant speak common but using some magic suddenly the players can converse with her. She explains that the temple once was found in an underwater society before dark forced befell it. Those same dark forces made all inhabitants go mad, except Tesh, who resisted the call of the Sea dragon. Soon after, anything living in the temple got petrified.
This room is also filled with statues. One door leads to the stairwell that goes up.
##### Room D:
Old magic mechanisms that were installed to keep the statue afloat.
### Floor 4
The entire floor is one room. There is a hole in the ceiling above the spiraling staircase, but no stairs which go there. In the room are four statues, each with their own inscription on the base. Each inscription is a hint to a puzzle and will slowly rotate the stairwell up a bit.
- One white marble statue of a demon standing in a burst of flames: From fire I was born, in fire I shall perish. Release me from my bonds to end my suffering. 
    - Apply fire to the statue to make it dissolve in flames.
- One white marble statue of a mermaid: Air suffocates me, water drowns me, food chokes me and stone holds me. Give me the right to breathe to end my suffering. 
    - A small pocked underneath the stonework in the neck of the mermaid hold a magical orb.
    - The orb allows water breathing for whomever is touching it.
- One black marble statue of a staggering horse with black pearl eyes: I am the messenger of all that ends, the reaper of souls. Give me suffering, show me death. 
    - Something needs to die for this statue to perish.
- One black marble statue of a humanoid it looks different to anyone who gazes upon it. It reflects the person looking at it: No identity holds me, no life envelops me, no feelings entrap me and no hurt ails me. Give me suffering, give me life. 
    - Once touched this statue will take on the form of a penanggalen: B3-217
Once all four statues have been destroyed, the stairwell will have risen high enough for travel to the next floor.
### Floor 5
A flabbergasted incubus looks at the players, he will fight them first before surrendering and exposing himself as Argentus Blakely. B3-73.
- Blakely hid himself in Tiressea where he disguised himself as a human diplomat in the golden district. When he heard the arcadian council was after him he made a deal with the mailman.
- Blakely is severely limited in his powers due to this deal.
- He wants to be a protected informant about Ouroboros.
