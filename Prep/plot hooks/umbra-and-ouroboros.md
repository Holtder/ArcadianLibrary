# Umbra and Ouroboros
## Umbra/Lady Dusseaux/Holstice
### Identities
The eponymous lady of the night know many names, but three of her names are relevant to this story, Lady Austra Dusseau, Maria Holstice and Umbra.

#### Lady Austra Dusseaux
In the old kingdom, Lord and Lady Dusseaux ruled over a small patch of land in what nowadays are the lands of Ulfgrim castle. They were harsh rules but their denizens were left wanting of little. As long as you complied, you had a comfortable life. Together with her husband she maintained order and upheld relationships with local lords. They proclaimed their hard work to be the labour of love for their lands.

#### Umbra
The true reason was a labour of love, just not for their underlings, as the Lord and Lady were necromancers. A ritual was conceived that would sap the live force of all the inhabitants of Dusseaux. During this process, Lord Dusseaux was turned into a lich, after which he put a spell on his wife, she would die on the spot, but be re√Øncarnated in a thousand years, when the stars would be right for the next lichdom ritual, so she could join him in eternal life. Little did they know that the passage of time without his loved one made the Lord depressed and withdrawn. Over time the years passed by like seconds while the mind of the Lich wandered. Over time Dusseaux's phylactery and mind crumbled, so did his body. The skull that remained, adorned with purple gems, is known as a demilich. A mindless, powerful skull in which the idle spirit deeply slumbers, never to return, forced to live out eternal life without any means of waking up.

#### Umbra/Maria Holstice
A thousand years later, Lady Dusseaux was reborn in a child's body, she grew up with the sole goal of finding her husband again. During the years she started a cult in reverence to her and her husband. The day that she found out what happened to her husband was shattering. Without him life nor undeath were worth having. On that day she went to the highest cliff underneath the flying city of Arcadia and let herself fall off. Unfortunately for her, the spell her husband put on her was never lifted. The next day she was reborn, again as a child, this time as the secret child of Thindar Holstice and Hobbs, little baby Maria. With all her memories and powers intact she realized that her reincarnation spell was also a curse, as she was bound to live without her love. Magically, using her trademark floating cloaks, she reached out to the leaders of her cult to prepare an attack on the ringkeep in a year, as she started to manipulate Thindar, slowly consuming her mind.

During the attack, also known to the Ringkeepers as the first night of darkness, Umbra escaped with Thindar, returning to her cult underneath Ulfloch. There she started planning, something big was necessary to rouse her husband from his slumber. Her first attempt was the clash between Agathor and Agadul, the demon twins and sons of Gruumsh. This was not enough. Two options were left, either try to bind Agaduls power to the skull, as the jolt of power would possibly wake him. The only other option was dangerous, too dangerous, even for Umbra, as only one cataclysmic event would then be enough, the re-awakening of Gruumsh himself. Possibly leading in the end of the world in the process.

Even Umbra is not sure yet if this is something she is willing to do, although, what is the worth of this world if she cannot live in it with her lovely Boris. While working on the preparations for this cataclysm, her other projects are magical disturbances on lower levels, such as binding her and his souls to agathor and agadul respectively, ramping up in strength. Her hope is that those methods may be effective enough before she has to resort to her last option.
