# Ulfgrim Arc
## Summary
Summary of upcoming arc:  
It turns out Thindar is not Umbra, her daughter, Maria, is the reincarnation of Umbra, Lady Dusseaux. The baby has put a spell on Thindar, controlling her from her baby body. Lord Hirm Graham is a far descendent of Lady Dusseaux and, in his own attempts of reaching immortality like his predecessors, started to dabble in the dark arts himself. While not a saint himself, wishes to help the Ringkeepers find her as he has been harassed by the cult of Ouroboros for a while now.  
  
Lady Fightmount is in a dungeon underneath the Ulfloch, an old area that once was the headquarters for Lord and Lady Dusseaux. In here a ritual will be taking place for Umbra to possess Fightmount, as she could use a more powerful host than the herbalist Thindar.  
  
The players will have to endure the difficulties of the court before gathering enough information to reveal the locations of Umbra's base. A puzzle outside the lake to reveal the entrance. A difficult and long dungeon to lead to the entrance. At the end the ritual will take place. The plot twist will be that Thindar is innocent and the baby is evil, wether they succeed or not decided with which host the baby will leave.  
  
During this arc players may find out about the Dusseaux family and their original lordship. Their evil background and the identity of Lord Duseaux is revealed in a later arc.
