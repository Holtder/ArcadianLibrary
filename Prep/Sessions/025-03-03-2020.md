## Intro
Music: Message for Cersei
A period of darkness approaches.
Three separate prophecies predict five days of darkness.
This world has already seen so much hurt. It has gone through so much pain.
Yet the denizens of the dark seem to be unrelenting in their pursuit of the light.
You three heroes have uncovered mysteries, and while some questions have been answered, even more have arisen from them.
You have been the pawns in a play between those larger than you. But today starts a new chapter.
One where the pawns will start taking their first steps in becoming Kings themselves.
While still resting from a week of victory, a week of loss, a week of despair and a week of hope, a small bird lands at your window.
You are staying at the Portsmouth, a small inn on the edge of the Arcadian docks.
You share a room, a soft warm summer wind slowly breathes the summers presence into it.
A red glow enters the room, the sun is rising, casting a long shadow on the floor.
All of you are awake, but no one has dared to break the first moment of peace you've had in days.
As you look through the sunlight, you see the shilouet of a hawk.
It slowly spreads its wings, seemingly strained from a long and arduous flight.
As it takes off again you hear a soft thud on the ground.
A small envelope, surrounded by black and white feathers.
