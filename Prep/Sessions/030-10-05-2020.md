## Summary:
Two warriors from the Nightmare Court have infiltrated the Mother tree by sneaking into the tower of Qilabar, one of the treetenders. They used his body to enter the tree. The remaining treetenders will reveal that due to the many battles, few actual warriors remain. In fact, the Ardent party is one of the four remaining parties. Two groups are scouts and a third is currently trying to infiltrate the Nightmare Court. It is up to the party to save the mother tree. After the sprouting ceremony, there will be some time to prepare for the dungeon. The dungeon will feature optional areas such as branches and hidden rooms.
## Ceremony
Music, Tranquility Base (Starbound), then fire keepers (DS2)
Takes place in a tent made from multiple green and red cloths. Sprouting ceremony will be a moment where all the players receive a small seed from a clay pot with a sun and a priestess engraved on it (Alyndal and Glamdolyn). The story of their people shall be told.:
> *A thousand years ago, two lone children were born in dirt and raised by ash. A youth intertwined and a life divided, meant only for each other yet fated to be ever apart. While divided, one of the two, now a young woman running away from herself, found a sanctuary here in this forest and tended to a small sapling. It was here, she decided, to wait for him, the other child.*
> 
> *He is a young man by this point, paying for a debt that is not his, running towards her, but never finding her. They survived darkness, they survived betrayal, but they did not survive time. A long time passes and the sapling had grown fiercely and strong. While caring for the small tree, the woman told stories of her long lost friend, who would one day come home to her. The sapling, her child, grew fierce and strong, in defiance of the dark age they were in. Red leaves would shine, giving the appearance of an everlasting sunset, giving remembrance to a time long lost. New denizens of the forest would be born from the red tree, filling Lotaari with a new generation of dryad.*
> 
> *The tree and all its creations are the children of the first tender, the mother, and her betrothed, the father. As the tree grew stronger, his tender would grow older and weaker. Then, one day, the young man, now a seasoned warrior, returned home, he had found the sanctuary. However, tragedy had struck, the nightmare had overcome the mother, the first treetender, and taken her final breath right before his eyes.*
> 
> *The entirity of Lotaari wept, yet no-one as hard as the father and his son. It was then when it all happened. The leaves started to shake, the ground to tremble. The once fiery red leaves fell blue, and the lifeless body of the mother dissapeared. The father realised what had happened, his son, who he had only now met, sacrificed himself to save his mother. The red tree became the mother tree. It is not known what happened then, but what we know is that the father left the sanctuary the next day, to fight off the darkness, as no tree should grow without light.*
> 
> *The next time he returned to her, he did as the phoenix in the sky, the sun that we all share, both inside and outside the forest, forever shining a light down on her, meant only for eachother yet fated to be ever apart.*
Then each member, including Tesh and Argentus, is asked to step on the middle ground of the tent, which has a small patch of fine dirt exposed. Each member has to plant their seed into the dirt and write their name in the sand on top of it. Then they have to leave the patch. One of the treetenders then places his hand on the side of the patch, on the sand. A wet spot appears and spreads to the five seeds. A ceremonial assistant unties a rope and lets it slide. One of the cloths on the roof drops to the side and light shines down directly on the names. The tender explains:
> *Once the sun returned to the sky, it chose to set anew the cycle of dawn and dusk, to show this world both its history and it's future. However, here, where the suns bethrothed rests, the sun never moves, never sets. If the tree is our nurturing mother, then the sun is the father whom protects us, ever vigilant. We are here to discern wether the mother and the father consider these five brave candidates as their children.*
A moment of silence passes, then something happens, from three of the five seeds, saplings grow. The players are have been chosen. The plants grow two feet high before they start curling a bit. At the end a small, red berry grows. It is about the size of a chestnut and softly glows. The tree tender gestures the players to take them and eat them.
> *You eat the berry, it has a sweet, strong odor. As you ingest it a warmth overcomes you. Meow, to you it feels like coming home after a long winter away as you hear a soft voice, words enter your mind yet you do not know what they say. Tarrok and Lozano, for you the warmth turns into heat, you feel a burning sensation inside your body. You can hear Tesh calling out to you, but it's distant, as if you were under water. As the burning fades you three become aware of your body, each small hair, each vein pumping the blood through your body. The inhale gives life, the exhale gives control. You see the mother tree as it stands under the sun. You three now can hear words you do not understand, this time from a soft, male voice. The ground underneath you gives way, darkness. Sight returns to you, as you all are lying on the ground in the tent. Tesh is holding Tarrok's hand. Argentus looks mortified at you. The keepers show a sign of relief.*
Vafir speaks:
> *Three have been chosen as children of the mother tree and the father sun. Take a short while to rest, then head on to the mother tree, she will let you pass now. Do as many have done before you and find inside the meaning to the signs that have been shown to you. Then find the intruders of your new home and bring them here.*
## Prep time
Improvise, players must approach tree alone. Explain that the tree is defending herself, you may be challenged. Each player may add their hit die to their max hp for the next three days.

## Mother tree dungeon
### Mechanics
##### Colored frogs
- Orange frogs - They explode violently like a grenade if they are stepped on or disturbed. Explode for 2d8 damage.
- Blue frogs - They won't hurt the players, but they will lick them if they are startled, and their lick can paralyze.
- Yellow frogs - They emanate waves of psychic power that ward off predators, players nearby will suffer hallucinations, fear, paranoia and a number of temporary mental debilitation (roll on a table) while inside the area of effect and if the frog is startled.

### Floors
##### 1F - The pond
`<a href="https://shmeppy.com/game/777740126">https://shmeppy.com/game/777740126</a>`
> As you enter the treebark closes behind you. You are in the base of the tree, plants surround you on each side, glowing flowers on the wall light the room. A small pond with some lillypads is filled with water that seeps down from the ceiling, to the side you can see brightly colored frogs. At the end you see a stairway.
Players can explore a bit, a few of each frogs are present and only use their effects if disturbed. If the urn is returned to its original position on 4F, reveal a small lockbox that contains the following ring:

##### 2F - The River
`<a href="https://shmeppy.com/game/1552457587">https://shmeppy.com/game/1552457587</a>`
> *As you walk up the stairs, you can hear the gushing of water. After a small hallway you see it, a not insignificant river is coarsing with high speeds through the room. The next staircase is up ahead, past the river.*
In the adjacent room lies a broken canoe and two peddles. The canoe has a large hole in the bottom. The coarsing river will take any players that fall into it, while scary it wont kill them as they'll fall into the pond one floor below.
##### 3F - The Island
`<a href="https://shmeppy.com/game/206813174">https://shmeppy.com/game/206813174</a>`
> *Again you hear water, yet instead of a rushing river, you now hear a babbling brook. More than half this room is filled with water, and inside the water, an island. A patch of grass decorates the island, which is accessible by a small bridge. On the grass patch you see three plants trimmed in the shape of elephants. Behind them you see a chest. On your right the wall is open, as you see a hallway going up and around the tree.*
![](http://vps.eholten.eu/uploads/images/gallery/2020-05/scaled-1680-/VfTD1av2ZlUW5Mkn-image-1589016630736.png)
In the chest is the following:
The Skeleton Key – Whenever the rogue is attempting to pick the lock with The Skeleton Key, he gets advantage. The key is shaped like a finger bone. Additionally, it is the lost finger of Scara which was enchanted.
3200gp
##### 4F - The secret sanctuary
[`https://shmeppy.com/game/9689780`](https://shmeppy.com/game/9689780)
> You make your way down and immediately find yourself in a pleasant mood, you do not know if it is the angle and warmth of the wind, or if it is the serenity of the sight in front of you, but you can feel the weariness of your climb disappearing. In Within a ring of water you can see a pedestal, with on top of it a small, clay urn. It is tipped over and water is streaming from it onto the ground, creating the ring of water.
Removing the urn stops the water from flowing and reveals the ring on 1F.
##### 5F
`<a href="https://shmeppy.com/game/1267604179">https://shmeppy.com/game/1267604179</a>`
> You see the remains of a campsite, a rug and some tents litter the room. It seems to be left in a hurry. On the far side the tree has an opening and you can see the horizon. A small extension of the tree forms a balcony with a campfire on it.
Inside one of the tents is a small pouch, it contains a locket with a picture of a female elf, a diary and about 375 gp.
Diary contents:
> Day 1: Figuring that we've spent the night here and there is no sign of us passing that creature anytime soon, I decided to write down my thoughts for a bit. Whatever is up there is scaring the bejeebus out of us. And I mean every one of us, even Ally and Serov, whom I thought to be made out of the same unshakable materials as their tools. Despite everything they went back up to fight the creature. We were all too scared to help them. Aleyev was damn near pissing his pants when he went up but it didn't stop him from walking up those stairs, cursing and all.
> 
> Why isn't the blasted thing following us?
> 
> Day 2: *First part scribbled black* FUCK. I really thought we had it. The moles never returned from their fight yesterday. While we were softly eating our breakfast, suddenly the rats perked up, as if convinced by something. Their eyes turned fierce, angry even. I've never seen the little tykes like that, all four of them quickly jamming their rations in their mouth before bolting off upstairs. You never know what to expect with them but this behavior is new. It sounded like a slaughter, at first, their screams were of blood thirst, then bloodcurdling screams of fear, then a deafening silence.
> 
> It's only Aldis and me now. Tomorrow we leave and try to fight it ourselves. I feel like we have no logical reason to wait until tomorrow. We might even have some advantage on the creature if we fight now, maybe the rats wore it down.
> 
> --
> 
> It's been a few hours, I tried signaling the treetenders. Through my binoculars I saw the two of them, just standing at the same spot for hours.
> 
> --
> 
> Still at the same spot.
> 
> --
> 
> I'm going to sleep, if I can.
> 
> ##### -- 
> 
> Fuck, they're still standing at the same spot.
> 
> Day 3: We went up the stairs, but I chickened out. I'm all alone now.
> 
> Day 4: Still at the same spot.
> 
> Day 5: Still at the same spot.
> 
> Day 6: Still at the same spot.
##### 6F
`<a href="https://shmeppy.com/game/1461191433">https://shmeppy.com/game/1461191433</a>`
On both sides of the room a lever is shown and if both pulled down, they will raise the grate. The NPC one floor above is initially hostile, but the players may try to convince her. The room is filled with moss-covered skeletons of the Ardent. They find a paralyzing toad (modified glacier toad):

##### 7F
`<a href="https://shmeppy.com/game/237613862">https://shmeppy.com/game/237613862</a>`
> You walk up the staircase and look around, Directly behind the stairs you took is a new set, but they are walled off by branches. To the right is an opening in the wall. It is quite the distance, but from it you see the other part of the trunk after it split. On it, at the same height, you can see a comparable opening as the one you are looking through.
Give the players a moment to look around before a hostile NPC shoots a gun. See Lirianne
If the players use the orange frogs to blow up the walls, grant access to hidden areas 7Fa and 7Fb
##### 7Fa - Meow's Altar
> As the debree falls down and the dust settles, you are welcomed by the rustling of leaves. You see a green meadow in front of you, adorned with trees and occupied by small critters, such as squirrels and rabbits. At the very end stands a stone altar, with a name on it: "Mohik Saria"
On the altar are two hands engraved, only fitting Meow. Should he put his hands in there, say that his eyes turn black and send him the following message:
> Mohik Saria, once named as the gift of the forest. Young child you have so many questions unanswered, yet you run from the only place that can answer them for you. You were a child from this forest long before your brothers have and you are always welcome to return here to spend your days, but this is not your home. Go to your village and seek answers there.
##### 7Fb - Lozano's Altar
> As the debree falls down and the dust settles, you so see light shining though. A wooden path, surrounded by grass leads directly to a small altar with no name on it, on the altar lies a bow
##### 8 - Boss area
