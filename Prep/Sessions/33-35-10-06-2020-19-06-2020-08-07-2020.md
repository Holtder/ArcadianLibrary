# 33/34 Prep
Summary:
A new ritual of four days will take place. The players must find ways to spend the time. See the page [Felbrook](http://vps.eholten.eu/books/the-arcadian-network/chapter/felbrook "Felbrook") for more information.
The players left off their session at the edge of the Forest. They can choose to spend some time in Thieves' End, but sooner or later they need to go to Felbrook. Mayor Dara Hordin will be ready to answer questions if nessecary.
Argentus will offer to go to the Arcadian University to research some of the dwarven ringgates, as he hasn't read up on them as much as he has of the ancient ringgates. If pressed he will open up.
- He will explain that ever since he lost his powers, he has felt useless and fragile.
- Last night he had an epiphany, the strange feeling he had in Thieves' End was not any magical sensation or demonic precognition, but a plain panic attack.
- He truly wants to help, as he has some debts to repay (to the heroes of time).
- It might not get his powers back, but it might not hurt to read up on the things he missed since the last time he was mortal, and maybe even learn some spells along the way.
- He'll suggest that he's leashed anyway, so where is he to go?
Tesh can join to make sure he makes it there and to hand him off, then she'll join the party in Felbrook.

## Felbrook
The players cannot teleport directly to Felbrook, but they can walk there from Arcadia, by teleporting to the ground, past the construction site that will soon be New Cliffside. It is a two day's walk from New Cliffside to Felbrook.
At the gates the playes will run into Borf. He will recognise them and welcome them, but he'll have a worried face on him. Apparently something happened to Wilhelm. At the circle tent, the players are welcomed by Caressing Boar, he is holding a baby and two little boys, one human, the other dryad, next to him. He will explain that the worst has happened, the healing process had failed and Wilhelm turned into a tree permanently. It was the first time this ritual was performed in centuries, so the chance of success was low anyway. The players can present the marble and the druids will see what they can do. The Hierophant and two druids are at the mountains right now and will return later tonight.
### Things to do:
If the players want to pass the time, here is a list of things the players can do.
#### Help wanted sign
- "Pest control in the forest! Save the Leshies!" - Caressing Bear. 
    - In the woods to the South live a small group of Leshies, they have been attacked recently by a horned beast, the Devil Monkey (bestiary 6, page 93)
- "Adventurers Wanted - With the opening of the Will'o Wisp tavern, we need entertainment, drinks half off I you can tell a good story!" - Lura Valwynn
- "Don't feed the deep blue? Don't mind a shark or two? Help me get some treasure and receive 40% of the profits!" - Stinging Bee 
    - Wrecked ship in the northeast has some treasures inside, 1500 gold to be precise, but players need to be able to breathe underwater and fight off a great white shark and two bull sharks. (B4-241)
    - Stinging Bee can be found on her ship, the Foul Stench.

# 35. Prep
pBegin this session in Toshio's room in the Will'o Wisp. Apparently the Orc of his group has been turning more and more angry the past few days and apparently is bent on killing Tarrok. Apparently Warbis went with him to calm him down. Let Toshio join the group as they search for Ash'er, as they are gone, Ouroboros makes their move.
Let the omens come together during this session, it is a prelude to the second day of darkness.
Extra omens during this session:
- As the players step outside, a vile, cold wind is blowing
- Ketephys' symbol trembles
- More roots have turned black, the hierophant has started muttering about the second day.
- The eyes of the statue of Pendlegast has started crying black goop.
- Dark clouds are awaiting off coast; shooting down lightning at the sea. They are not approaching.
On the road on pendlegast peaks, fight a Flailsnail and two Flumphs. At some point you can find Warbis nearly beaten to death against a treestump, he breaks his vow of silence as he pleads Toshio to flee, something dark has taken over Ash'er. At a forest clearing on a hill the players find Ash'er, maddened by anger.
Once defeated, or beated sense into, the players will return to town. Wilhelm wakes up, make it exciting. End on a cliffhanger that the town will be attacked this night, Wilhem saw it in his dreams. Maybe sass the players a bit as they were missing the signs.
# Barfight at the Will'o Wisp
### Summary
The players were loud yesterday and some patrons of the Will'o Wisp do not take that in kind. They provoke the players in making the first hit so they can let off some steam in a barfight.
### Background
The druids of the Fox hail from the Vulpine Woods and are a defensive people. In Tiressea, where magic is outlawed, these druids have to fight for their existence and to protect the denizens of the forest. Fox druids are trained in combat and are often armed to the teeth.
### Warning Signs
##### First thing in the morning:
> At a point in the middle of the conversation, Lura approaches you. She seems to have a distressed look on her face as she starts speaking. If you have any matter to attend to right now I suggest you go and do them. Yesterday a group of druids arrived from the Vulpine woods, I strongly suggest you keep out of their path.
If the players inquire, give them some information about the Vulpine Woods and the prosecution of magic users by the Spellbreakers.
#### Through the day
> You see a peculiar pair of druids passing you by. At first they catch you eye because, unlike your usual druids, these are wearing metal studded leather and a hooded cape made of pelt over their shoulders. You see a spiked club hanging from their side and each of them has three spears on their back. The one to the left is a full-blooded orc, but the other of the two is the one that grabs your attention. This individual, who you surmise to be about the same length as Lozano, is completely covered in amber colored fur. Their face is long and pointy, like a snout, and it's decorated with two pointy ears. At this individual's backside, you see a long and thick tail, amber colored with a white end. This person, just as their ally, is wearing metal studded leather. The orc catches your gaze and calls out to you: Oi! Wuddya want?!
If a conversation comes from this, imply that they are not in the mood for fighting but are quite annoyed by the players. Suggest taking it outside the tavern tonight. Goad them into fighting.
### Fight
Use whenever appropriate; at some point the orcs are going to be frustrated enough with the PCs to approach them, especially the Orc will get inches from Tarroks face, while the Kitsune gets dangerously close to Meow with a hand on his club.
If a fight breaks out, it will turn out Wild Boar was in the room as well and will gladly take part, not equipping her axe but fistfighting both parties while still holding her tankard.
## NPC's
### Ash'Er

Male Orc, pronounced Ash-Eer, this brawns over brains fellow is keen on protecting his other two group members. He is also a bit of a hothead and triggered by loud people.

# Dark Omens
Umbra and her cult, Ouroboros, is attempting to kidnap Wilhelm after he completes his ritual. They will arrive in skull-adorned boats, from the mountains and from the forest.
### Signs
In the days before, certain signs will present themselves as hints:
##### Darkroots
Caressing Bear or Wild Boar: two of the roots of the tree Wilhelm is growing in have turned black.
##### Strangers
Cyran: rumor has it a band of cloaked figures have set up camp somewhere in Pendlegast Peaks. It was the reason the Hierophant had run up the mountains in the first place.
##### A storm's a brewin'
Stinging Bee:
> Stinging bee is sitting on the bow of her ship, legs hanging off the edge. Unlike her previous unruly demeanor, there is something serene about her now. The wind softly blows through her wind as she stands up, and she speaks, A storm is brewing, it's a few days off, but something along the horizon.
##### The mouthy cave
At the base of the mountains a small entrance to a mine has appeared. The curious thing? Felbrook was never a mining village? Turns out it is a mimic planted there by Ouroboros to distract the people of Felbrook.
# Intros
## 33. Intro
During their time in the Lotaari Greenlands, each member of the Ringkeepers had attained something. Lozano attained a bow of unknown origin, Meow had been shown a vision he had tried to forget, and Tarok had proof his sister was alive. Not only was Scara alive, her life led her down a path of shady practices, not unlike her brother. With her collar in his hand and the deformed head of Ra'adok on his hip, Tarok had more questions than before. Who are the members of the Five Pronged Star, who is Clegg Zincher, does Brandir have more secrets than he lets on to and what is Scara's role in all of this? At least he now has the knowledge she is alright and can handle herself.
The night after the group left the forest, the forest changed, trees joined and branches thickened, as the greenlands shut themselves off from the outside world. Lodged in the bark of one of the trees was an amber orb, inside of it a seed just like the one of the acceptance ritual our heroes partook in earlier. A message called out to them, "Everyone has a role in the forest, it is the role of birds to take seeds and spread life all around the world. This seed is for a Hawk."
The heroes know what this means, as they set off to Felbrook, to find Wilhelm Brightrun. Alions last words to them rings in their head "Love is never lost, only forgotten, especially within family"
## 34. Intro
The group had settled down in Felbrook for a few days, as they waited for the final part of Wilhems ritual to be completed.
## 35. Intro
Last time we saw our adventurers, they battled a local group of sharks to the death for the treasures of the Orchis; in the end, the Ringkeepers brought back the funds and the local orphanage was saved. To celebrate, Stinging Bee gathered a few of her friends and together with our heroes, drank until after the sun had set. Before the group went to sleep, Stinging Bee mentioned something about an oncoming storm. One night remains, at the end of tomorrow, Wilhelm's ritual should be completed. And if you all remember correctly, once you two, Lozano and Meow returned to your room, number 16, you found one bed to be empty. (Look around mischievously)
Tarrok; as the morning comes you feel the weight of the world weighing down on you. Your head is pounding, your joints hurt. You try to open your eyes, but you don't see a thing. It seems you are blindfolded. You try to move but you feel twine rope pulling itself into your skin, it burns a bit. You have your hands tied against your back. The hard wooden floor is hurting your behind, as you start wondering. Is this were the fun begins? Or where it ends? You hear some movement, some hair brushes past your skin. As you try to speak, you notice you've been gagged by a cloth. A voice speaks out, it is soft, but you think it's a male voice.
> "You finally awake?" I want you to know this is for your own good. Ash'er hasn't been the same since we got here and I think he's out for blood. Your blood. I am going to remove the cloth in your mouth now. Know that if you scream, it will be your last.
# The Crystal Caverns Minidungeon
[https://shmeppy.com/game/1582158019](https://shmeppy.com/game/1582158019)
This mine is new, people didn't even know it was there. Turns out, the whole cave is a mimic.
[![image-1643828654402.png](https://dnd.eholten.eu/uploads/images/gallery/2022-02/scaled-1680-/image-1643828654402.png)](https://dnd.eholten.eu/uploads/images/gallery/2022-02/image-1643828654402.png)
vlnr: room 1,2,3
A minecart track leads to room 2
#### Room 1
Room has 7 chests inside it, two are mimics, four are empty and the last one is filled with 250 gp.
#### Room 2
This room has the end of the minecart track. In this room, acid seeps from the walls and drips to a puddle in the middle as it runs toward the far end the room in a small, 2 feet wide hole. Hear some rumbling and gurgling from the hole. A small, boulbous lob of flesh is hanging from the ceiling. It is the uvula of the mimic. If they punch it, a loud gurgling sound will be heard from the hole and an escape sequence happens.
#### Room 3
One mimic and filled with explosive crystals.
# The Sunken Ship Minidungeon
## Pre fight
> As you approach the ship with your rowboat, more and more details of it become apparent. The ship is leaning against a rock, keeping it in place like the day it went into the storm. Slanted in a 45 degree angle, the bow of the ship points to the sky, giving it almost a triumphant look, having survived the elements for so long. That is the only triumphant thing about it sadly. Both masts are long gone with no sail in sight. Gaping holes in the side of the hull suggest the lower part of the ship is completely submersed. In dilapitated golden letters you can make out the ship's name: The Orchis. A rope ladder hangs from the middle of the Orchis, it seems old and rotten.
The players will approach the Orchis on a small rowboat. They can see sharkfins in the distance (perception DC 13). Part of it is above water as it leans against the side of a rock, but as soon as all three members are standing on the ship, let them make a check to walk carefully (DC 13 acrobatics). The ship is at a 45 degrees angle with the bow facing upwards.
The ship has two floors (see shmeppy) and the lower part of the ship can only be approached from the front of the ship. The upper level is divided in three rooms. The first room is the one you walk into as you enter the insides of the ship, its the Mess (living room). To the back of the ship you reach a small room where rations are saved, and due to the age of the rations it's quite pungent in there. Behind that is the captains lodge (hidden bottom in drawer, perception DC 15). The front part of the ship is filled with hangmats, it's where the crew would sleep, from there people can reach belowdecks where the cargoroom is, which is completely empty (as Stinging Bee said, the ship had sold all of its contents before sailing off. If the ship hasnt sunk yet by this point, it is half submerged in water with the far end being completely under water, the sides are busted and holes to the outside are apparent. Behind that room is the treasury with a chest full of money. (2500 GP)
Note, after sinking completely the ship will land on its side.
## Combat
As soon as the ship sinks, sharks will be attracted to the commotion. Depending on where the players are the sharks will enter the ship through the holes in the cargo hold.
### Enemies:
#### Great White Shark (Bestiary 4 - Page 241)
Prerolled initiative - d20[18] + 6 = 24
> This immense silvery beast oozes strength, power, and speed. Its gigantic maw is lined with rows of ragged-looking teeth, and its pitch-black, emotionless eyes give nothing away.
[![image-1643828675864.png](https://dnd.eholten.eu/uploads/images/gallery/2022-02/scaled-1680-/image-1643828675864.png)](https://dnd.eholten.eu/uploads/images/gallery/2022-02/image-1643828675864.png)
#### Two Bull Sharks (Bestiary 4 - Page 241)
Prerolled initiative - d20[15] + 6 = 21
> This sleek, gray predator weaves back and forth through the water with savage grace.
[![image-1643828679963.png](https://dnd.eholten.eu/uploads/images/gallery/2022-02/scaled-1680-/image-1643828679963.png)](https://dnd.eholten.eu/uploads/images/gallery/2022-02/image-1643828679963.png)
