## Intro
Venturing deeper into the Den of the Rat King, you found yourselves in the traincar graveyard of the Oph subway system. However, not all was right. The gigantic room, which seemed like it once was a rail yard, was now the ashen remains of an explosion that occurred long ago. It took some tinkering and searching, but before you knew it you found a stone circular slab with a rune indented into its sides. You found out that sliding your finger across the rune charges it, making it grow stronger for each second you rest your fingers on it. You do not know how far it will go, but you do know it was strong enough to kill three intrepid, celestial adventurers in the graveyard. 

Afterwards you found a derelict locomotive with in it's console a slot that would fit the one foot diameter slab, which fired up the engine and brought you deeper into the den. Which is where we are now. The locomotive stands on a large stone turning table, with directly underneath it ten statues of rats with their tails intertwined. Ten rat statues, ten closed large stone doors and ten rails leading up to them. You have finally and truly entered the Den. Putting the slab on a socket in the rat statue turned the turnstile, taking it and then socketing it into the related door opened it. Removing it however, closed the door again, which made you realise that, at least for this first door, you wouldn't be able to take either the slab or the locomotive with you. We left off last time with Tarrok, Lozano, Meow and Woof entering the dark hallway. 

> **Runic fireball (X is seconds held)**
> When the stone is activated by running a finger along the rune, it will charge until the finger is removed from the stone. A fireblast will appear in a X\*5 feet cone, doing Xd6 damage. Reflex save 20 halves damage.


## Dungeon Layout
This dungeon will make use of the ice sigil/slab, which has the following power:

> **Runic Icesheet (X is seconds held)**
> When the stone is activated by running a finger along the rune, it will charge until the finger is removed from the stone. A one-inch thick sheet of ice as wide as the slab itself appears on either side of the stone. The length of the sheet is 5ft\*X. If the sheet hits a solid object heavier than the slab (and the person holding it), the slab (and it's holder) are pushed backwards at high speed, causing X\*d4 damage on impact, reflex DC 20. The sheet is always able to hold one person. Walking across a horizontal beam of ice requires a DC5 acrobatics. Climbing up a sloped beam is not possible without special equipment. It is possible to remove the disc from the created sheet and take it with you, but creating a new sheet evaporates the old one. 

The rooms have double gravity, which halves movement speed. Meow can still fly, but won't be able to carry people without succeeding a DC20 strength check each round. 

### Room 1 - tutorial
> You follow the dark corridor for a while, the sensation of the musty and odorous dark tunnels leaves you, as new sensations fill your skin and nostrils. A sharp, cold draft catches you, the cold penetrates your skin and shivers your bones. Wherever you are going, it is *arctic*. You pull up your hoods to protect yourself from the gusts. Every step you take heavier. Your feet stomp on the ground as you put them down and your clothes start weighing you down. You all find that your movement slows down as a result. A light in the distance grows closer as the end of the tunnel draws near. Your eyes adjust to the light and see the following:

> The room is 25 by 50ft wide. The ground, the walls, the ceiling, everything is made entirely from ice. A dull green light shined up from beneath you, illuminating the room almost like a gentle aurora borealis. You feel your feet slip and shiver beneath you, but by not making any sudden movements, you keep your ground. Your side of the room appears to be a plateau stretching from side to side, going ten feet in front of you. Then the floor drops down 10ft. The ground underneath is the same type of ice, across the room is another plateau like yours.  A huge slab of ice stands close to the edge of your side of the room. A small stone disc, similar to your earlier sun sigil stone, is lodged into the ice of the slab. 

A perception check will reveal several marks of impact across the walls.

Mechanics: 
- The players must first take the slab from the ice and test it's mechanics out. 
- The trick is not to activate it while holding it but to keep it next to the side of the slab.

A door on the opposite side leads to the next room. 

### Room 2 - Reflections of the seasons
- A 35 by 35ft room
- A soft light blue, 1ft wide beam of light shines out of a small hole through the north wall. Ice crystals in the air make it shimmer and shine. Text above it says "Nay but the coming of the sun may make the winter dissapear"
- The light leaves the room through a similar hole on the south side. "Spring brings the blue sky and the blue sky brings the green fields"
- In the room are two large mirrors, adorned with intricately decorated edges of small rates ice skating.
- The exit across from the room is completely covered in a magical wall of ice. 
- Each reflection recolors the light, cycling through blue -> purple -> yellow -> green. the players need to place the disc close to the porthole from which the light comes, in additon to moving the mirrors to make the angular S rune that is found on the sun sigil they've acquired earlier, the three reflections make it green, once the green line is shone into the porthole, the ice on the door melts.

>**As you step through the archway, the air changes.**  
The chill here is different — not the biting wind of the tunnels, but a still, crystalline cold that hangs heavy in the lungs. A faint shimmer dances in the air, as if the frost itself is alive. From a small, round aperture in the **north wall**, a **narrow beam of soft, light‑blue radiance** spills into the room. It’s no ordinary light — ice crystals drifting lazily through it catch and scatter the glow into a thousand tiny rainbows. Above the aperture, words are etched in delicate script:

_“Nay but the coming of the sun may make the winter disappear.”_

> The beam stretches in a perfect line across the chamber, vanishing into a matching hole in the **south wall**, where another inscription waits:

_“Spring brings the blue sky and the blue sky brings the green fields.”_

> Two **tall, ornate mirrors** stand on heavy ice bases, their silvered faces pristine and their frames carved with tiny figures of rats in mid‑stride, frozen forever in the act of ice skating. The floor beneath them is slick and faintly reflective, as though the whole room is a frozen lake. Across from where you stand, the **exit door** is sealed behind a thick, **opaque wall of solid ice**.

### Room 3 - Cold front

Summary: Saumen Kar Monster fight, several platforms, each third turn the platform the players are on is showered with icicles. The monster has DR15, each activated rune (using the disc) removes 5.

**Dimensions:** ~60 ft × 40 ft (12 × 8 squares)  
**Legend:**
- `#` = Solid ice wall
- `.` = Open icy floor
- `~` = Chasm / freezing water (10–15 ft drop)
- `P` = Raised platform (10 ft high)
- `E` = Exit door (sealed by magical ice)
- `S` = Saumen Kar starting position
- `X` = Icicle hazard zone (falls every 3 rounds)

**Room Features & Flow**
**1. Platforms & Gaps**
- Ice cold water runs between the ice sheets, too wide to jump in most places.
- Only way to cross quickly is with the Runic Disc

**2. Rune Circles
- Three total, each on a different platform.
- To weaken the Damage Resist on the monster, all three must be activated by shining a **green beam** from the disc into the matching wall rune.
- Players must reposition during the fight to hit each one.

**3. Hazards
- Every 3 rounds, an **icicle barrage** drops in one of these zones (Reflex DC 18 half, 3d6 piercing + 1d6 cold).
- Forces movement and discourages turtling.

**4. Saumen Kar
- Starts on the central platform, using **wall of ice** to block direct routes.
- Will leap gaps, smash ice beams, and use knockback to push PCs into chasms.
