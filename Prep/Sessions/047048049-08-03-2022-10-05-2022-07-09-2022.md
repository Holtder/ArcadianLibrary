# Intro
Dark medieval blues, first song in court playlist
In character of Lord Hirm Graham.
> Ah, the sun rises on my humble abode, Ulfgrim castle. From a particularly shady corner of my bedroom balcony I look at all that is mine, and can only smile. So many underlings, so much strife. And last night I was blessed with the presence of newcomers; oh how the water ripples in my little pond of solitude. They've found themselves in quite some trouble, but a generous Lord such as I spared them of any legal ramifications. It's what I do.
> 
> However, these ungrateful welps came begging for more. Information they say. Our precious Lady they say! Well what about their precious Lord! What do I want? What do I get? I sent them away, slithering back to Donovans little hole in the ground, let them panic for a moment. Stew for a bit if you will. They'll be back. The only thing I want is a favor, some quid pro quo.
> 
> Well if that is not to their liking, I'll give them an offer they cannot refuse. I already feel it, this one is going to be a whopper!
> 
> (deranged gniffling)
Normal narration:
> The sun has indeed risen, as our heroes walk back into town. Guards have already taken care of the bodies, but an eerie silence has replaced the midnight chaos that you've left behind. After a tense exchange with Hirm Graham, now confirmed to be the vampire lord of Ulfgrim, Lozano, Meow and Thaddeus leave nearly empty handed. There are some leads though. Who is Forsha, Donovan's business partner? What happened to Donovan's niece in the forest? Who attacked the dwarven brothers? What is Graham's right hand's role in all of this? These questions linger as the heroes take part in a sobering breakfast in Wilhelm's magical cart. Argentus and Tesh, already dressed up as Sir Byron and Amy the assistant, have joined you. Argentus starts speaking through his partly masticated bread: "You know if it were up to me we don't wait for this guy's second offer and just abandon this hellhole. Let's look for our lady somewhere else; this Lord just thinks he can push us around? No, I say we find the Lady on our own."
# Session Prep
Have the players eat their breakfast and discuss their plan. There are a few leads to go into:
### Back to the Lord:
> (Play melting waltz)
> 
> You can hear sounds of merryment and music. As the doors open to the main hall, the music grows louder. You are greeted by the sight of a mass of people, all dancing in pairs. Their pale visage is unmoving, not an eye blinks or a mouth twitches, as everyone in the room takes perfect part in the choreography. Up ahead where the Lord and his court resided earlier, now is displayed a construction that resembles multiple musical instruments at once. Several brass horns aimed at the ceiling, cimbals, strings and drums decorate the complex machine as the music of a whole orchestra seems to emerge from it. In the middle of the machine you see one of the courts members playing the instrument. It is the merry halfling with the feather in his cap. Cogwheels move as he turns levers and presses buttons, sweat drips from his forehead. He moves the music as much as the music moves him. And as he increases the speed of his playing, so do the dancers, if he slows down, so do his musical denizens. A few moments pass as you look onto this spectacle, until you hear a familiar voice to the right. "I gather you are looking for the young Lord?" The pale elf Varesh Gordo has joined you.
Gordo will bring the heroes to Hirm's office. The Lord has a second offer, it is twofold;
- The heroes come to his next birthday. No snake under the grass or hidden meaning behind the request. They are free to leave the moment they enter the castle grounds, but it would be nice to have a small who's who at his next big celebration.
- The heroes clear out the intruders in the dungeon underneath the Ulfloch. 
    - It has been raided time and time before by other adventurers, especially the Children of Desna, so there is nothing to gain there.
    - The group that has taken residence over there seems to be a local cult that reveres a lich of the past.
If they agree to the former and succeed in the latter, the Lord will tell them whatever they want to know. Hirm will seem bored that they agreed to such mundane conditions.
# Dungeon 1
### Outside
An old man named Frigo Gandrup has a small fishing boat at the pier. He'll allow the heroes to go to the small island in the middle of the lake if the Lord ordered it.
> As the small rowboat bobs in the water towards the island, you can slowly make out more if it. The island in the middle of the Ulfloch only features a few leafless trees, that slowly sway in the wind. The grey skies make it all seem a bit eerie. The boat reaches land and you now see the only other feature on this dot of land. A well, about three meters in diameter. The stone bricks that shape the well are almost completely covered in moss. As the soft valley wind passes the well, a whistling howl can be heard.
### Room 1
The players must find out a way to get to the bottom of the well. It is six meters deep and still has water in the bottom. An exit can be seen near the water's surface. On the north wall of the well are dark grey stone spheres with a horizonal line through each of them, about the size of a skull. As someone makes sound near them, they open at the slits, as they are all magical stone eyes. In the water is an enemy, a bloody bones. That creature is awakened if the eyes are triggered, or 1d4 rounds after the players touch the water.
The bottom of the water features a leather pouch with gems, worth 200gp. Perception DC 25.
### Room 2
> The tunnel opens into a large cone-shaped room. On the opposite side a large metal door stands wide open. Beside it on each side stand two statues of knights, barely recognisable. Behind each of the statue tremendous gears can be seen churning, as their soft clicking fills the room. The air reeks of incense.
Behind each statue are two Festrogs hiding, immediatly roll for initiative. Behind each statue is a lever, one closes the door (Disable device DC 30) and the other triggers a pendulum blade in the three squares in front of the gate. They all spring into action as one player enters those spaces.
The room is filled with signs that there were once traps that were disabled. And the current pendulum trap was rebuilt from those parts. This was done by Grimbal Slipstone (more on that later).
### Room 3
> Within this room stands the disfigured corpse of a cleric. Its eyes and mouth stitched shut with coarse cord. In one if it's desiccated hands, it clutches a weird metal cage with a rotting dwarf's head bolted within. The room is otherwise empty, as if the created were imprisoned here or locked up for safekeeping.
This creature is the dead cleric Cilios, who is a CR5 mummy and will attack on sight. He only has 5ft sight.

The head can be used to ask three questions
### Room 4
> Within this athenaeum is a grid of square pillars. each carved with words large enough to be readable when standing at an arm's length. At first glance you see some places where a pillar was chiseled down and affixed with a flat square slab of stone. Perhaps as a revision or correction to the writing. Some sort of humanoid creature is visible on the floor near the back of the room, moving restlessly.
As the players enter the room, they'll see a CR5 wraith flying about, with the resemblance of a dwarf missing a head. It will dismiss the players and just move between the pillars. It wont even respond to attacks. Only touching the corpse will trigger it, the first time a warning howl, the second time it will attack. If the head of the dwarf is reconnected to the body it will crumble to ashes, freeing the wraith as well.
Lore: the body and head of the dwarf are from an engineer that was kidnapped by Ouroboros.
Pillars are in a language from the old times and can only be deciphered by magic or linguistics DC 20. It recounts the following:
- A tragic story of a married couple of wizards, who sought out immortality.
- The ritual to achieve it could only be performed once every thousand years.
- The couple decided that the woman perform the ritual on her husband.
- Afterwards, she would sleep for a thousand years, waiting for her turn, as her husband would make preparations for her ritual.
- A thousand years passed, and the young woman would awaken from her slumber, seemingly not aged a day.
- She sought out her husband.
- As it turns out, he finished preparations after fifty years. He then waited for her, slowly running out of things to do as to pass the time, as nothing was quite the same without her.
- Over time, he would just sit on his throne and stare, as his mind would slowly crumble over the centuries.
- His immortal body would persist, despite his mind slowly fleeting away.
- There was no husband left, only his soulless yet alive body.
- The woman, grief stricken, tried to end her life, as eternal life had no meaning without her husband.
- Then it was revealed that her husband had already performed the ritual, and she as immortal as well, doomed to wait out eternity and for her mind to slip as well.
# Intro 2
> The eery Ulfloch lies silent. The time of day is unclear, as the skies have been gray since dawn. A soft trickle of droplets meet the faces of Meow, Lozano and Thaddeus. A firm, cold wind sways the trees hard enough that the rustling of leaves is noticable from a distance. In the centre of the lake lies a small island, adorned with one tree and a wide-berthed well. It is on this patch of land that the heroes were told they would find what they were searching for. Underneath this island lies a ransacked dungeon, which has been empty for ages. This dungeon is now occupied once more. Down there the foul cult Ouroboros commit their profane rituals. Down there they serve and revere their dark lords and ungodly demons. Down there they keep that which has been captured, who the heroes hope to find and return to power once more. Down there is Lady Fightmount, and who knows, maybe even Umbra herself.
> 
> As I mentioned this island features a well. This well is a few meters wide and well constructed. The inner sides are adorned with thick stone orbs, with horizontal slits through the middle. At the bottom of the well lies a cloudy, dark pool of water, which houses dirt, dead foliage and other nastyness. Failing in their attempt to quietly rappel down, they trigger some sort of mechanism, as all the orbs open at the slits, widening their concrete eyelids and revealing large, irisless eyes with pitch black pupils.
