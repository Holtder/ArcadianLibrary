- The players are in a safehouse in the Den, one of the slums of the city that houses the Horde
- They intend to find the dog pound in wall street
Have them walk around in wall street, make it a financial hellscape where every worker is in over their heads. Typewriters can be heard in the distance. At some point people will complain about "the howling, the awful howling". Meow can hone into his senses and hear the howling of dogs in the distance.
> As you walk the curbs of wall street, ears deafened by the cacaphony of typewriters and cars whizzing by, you see something out of the ordinary: an actual door. Not just a regular door, it is a two paned glass sliding door with lettering in front of it:
> 
> - - Ohp Animal Pound: Not all dogs go to heaven - -
### Lobby
Completely trashed, no sign of life whatsoever, to the back of the room is a gated room with a staircase on the inside. A sign says: leave now, the lost animals must never be released. A key is hidden in a hidden compartment at the front desk.
