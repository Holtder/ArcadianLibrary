# Intro - A new chapter begins
Song - 時計の針の音
Silence fills the final room of the dungeons underneath the Ulfloch. Thaddeus, you can feel your tiger heart thump rapidly in the back of your head as the adrenaline courses through your body. You look down at the aftermath of what had just happened. Your bloodstained claws rest on the mangled remains of Thindar Holstice, Umbra. What is left inside her ripped robes is barely recognizable as the half elf she once used to be. Inside her demolished ribcage, swaddled in a bloody cloth, lies an infant body, lifeless. You look around in a daze. You see the pedestal and altar from which Umbra was spouting her profane predictions and casting her foul ritual. You see the changing pit in the middle of the room, and to the side, safely secured, Lady Jaina Fightmount, still unconscious and tied up. Next to her is Meow, kneeling down next to her and checking her well-being. You cannot make out if she is from this distance. Next to them, close to one of the curious stakes in the ground that appeared during the fight, sits a snow-white young little rabbit. You see Aloy landing beside it and sniffing at it curiously.
Lozano, your mind races back and forth as you ponder the curse Umbra put on you, and how her death did not seem to revert it. You recall her cries as she perished, "Not again" her words were. She lamented her fate, not as cries from someone who was going to lose it all, but as someone who was facing an annoying setback. You feel weak, diminished even. The world seems large to you and your connection to Ketephys feels strained. What just happened, did you win?
Meow, you land beside Lady Fightmount, gently nudging her to see if she responds. She feels cold to the touch, but she is breathing. The necklace around her neck features a large blue gemstone which is glowing brightly. Her eyes twitch before slowly opening. She looks at you and starts speaking. "Is she gone?"
# Important notes
## Itinerary
- Give recap, mention the end of Umbra, how it went and the aftermath, especially the part that Lozano became a Rabbit, 
    - Conversation with Lady Fightmount
    - She'll teleport the group to the lake coastline. The lake isn't as still anymore as it used to be.
- Go back to Ulfgrim Castle, have Hirm Graham laugh at them especially at Lozano, explain how they may have delayed the plans of Ouroboros, but hasn't stopped it yet. 
    - Dance around the subject, but try to find out what the players remember about Lady Umbra's fate.
    - Lady Fightmount will ask the players if it's ok if she teleports herself back to the Ringkeep at this point, as she is unable to clear Lozano's curse and needs to recover. She'll tell Hobbs of the fate of his wife and daughter.
    - Graham will want to protect his investment, so he'll help Lozano back to his original self.
    - He'll suggest them to find some Prayer's Acumen, a special herb. If made into a tea and drank by a cleric that adheres to the teachings of nature, it may restore his connection to Ketephys.
    - Won't know where to get this, Captain Wilhelm Brightrum mentions that they should the Druids of the Heron. He mentions he feels a sense of kinship to Felbrook.
    - *Laugh like Ted Danson at the end of season one of the Good place, but a bit slower.*
- Leave in the fancy cart of Wilhelm 
    - Give time to discuss.
- Arrive at Felbrook 
    - Sandbox, use old notes for it
- Ritual 
    - The druid's circle will order the Treetenders to set up a circle at the stone slab where the fight with the hags took place. In the middle a small dog bowl with a green substance inside of it. Meow and Thaddeus need to be beside him to pull him back if something happens. To the side of the circle the tenders will sit, chanting a few phrases.
    - Lozano will be pulled inside the bowl and wake up in a plane of darkness, back to his original shape but with bunny ears and a soft white nub of a tail. Aloy will be beside him. He'll find Meow and Thaddeus in the darkness. Next the three of them soar through the sky on the back of a gigantic Aloy.
    - They see the Cold wastes, Arcadia, Siressea. Then the flight goes over the ocean north of Siressea and they find new lands, with large cities, unique and alien architecture, they see races they have never seen before. They travel the world for a while silently, before returning to their own continent. They follow the coastline to the east, beyond the darklands into the land of the free cities. Many ships sail these seas and before they know it Aloy flies over a large crater, kilometers wide. Aloy lands in the absolute centre of it. In the middle lies a small chest. Inside it is a note. It reads "Become the hunter once more, find your heritage, find Lysanthir."
    - Suddenly the dream pauzes, wind stops blowing, trees seems to stop moving. A dark voice echoes. It is Agadûl, thanking them for freeing him. He calls out the party to meet him at this very location. The bunny knows where to find it.
    - Suddenly two tree wardens grow from the ground, a tendriculos and a quickwood, both reacting to the demonic incursion, they want to repel it and zero in on Aloy.
