# Intro
Intro song:
For those willing to look for it, the rot of Oph is always visible, for those willing to listen to it, it can easily be heard. For those willing to feel for it, the rot of the city is palpable. Willing or not, down in the ratways, one breath brings about the smell of rot and the taste of decay. Not long after closing the case of Woof, you run into new troubles, as you found the desecrated body of Mortar. Your investigationwork took you deep into the Pits, where you found a demon named Gutsnarl. Gutsnarl is a demonn specialized in splicing, a craft that exchanges parts of your ethereal soulbody for soulstones, and replaces it with demonic parts. This foul art diluting the once complete souls of the desperatie. Mortar turned out to be the middle man for a meetup between Gutsnarl and Alan Farthing, a public prosecutor of Oph, who was interested to learn about splicing. Secondly, the bodyparts that were made for Mortar were that of a shapeshifting demon, causing it to look like Mortar's original body, covering up any evidence. The only original part of him was his heart.
You were faced with a choice follow up on the lead that is Alan Farthing, and see if you can find him at the District Attorney's office, in Lasscapale? Or will you be looking for freedom first, by participating at the Blood Bowl. You chose the former, and took the subway to Lasscapale. Unfortunately, not long after departing, you ran into some goons of the Horde.
These kind of settings show why the Ringkeepers are the heroes people say they are. Presented with an unusual setting which limits their ability to fight they shine the most. Years of experience has allowed them tot take these limitations and turn them around on their enemies. Years of arcane lore and the acquesition of magical artifacts will make them a force to be reconed with and they (...) *wait. Say that again? They did WHAT?!*
Everyone, make please write down your flat footed AC and also write doen the results of a reflex save, two fortitude saves and an initiative roll. Meow, your reflex save is with advantage. Bane, your save is with disatvantage.
# Layout
### First fight (I)
Rolls for landing:
> As you are standing in the cart, suddenly, you arent. The lights that are affixed to the ceiling suddenly arent. The ones that do not immediatly shatter zip by you. The sheets of metal that form the walls around you start rending apart as the darkness of the tunnels envelop you. you are hit by the full blast of glass shards, metal shavings and sparks of the metal grinding against the stone wall. Everyone with a flat footed AC below 18, you take 2d6 shrapnel damage.
> 
> As your eyes start to adjust you all continue to fly through the dark tunnel. Time is flowing in slow motion as you see the walls, floor and ceiling of the subway tunnel replace eachother in quick succession. You are tumbling, fast. Everyone who had a reflex save lower than 15 takes 4d6 blunt force trauma damage. Everyone who makes it halves damage except for Meow, if you made it you don't take any damage.
> 
> Your bodies are forced to the ground with serious impact. Not only does the bone crunching force shake your body to it's core, the slime and moss covered walls and ground tear your skin asunder. Everyone who hit the ground, choose one of your fortitude rolls: if it is lower than 15, you take 1d6 extra poison damage and become sickened (give cards).
> 
> As the concussive force expended on your body wears off, you take a deep gasp. You immediatly feel the horrid fumes of these tunnels enter your lungs and instinctively try to hold your breath but it is too late. The toxins and fungal spores in the air take root and try to nestle in your body. One final fortitude save, if you have two fortitude saves left, pick the higher one. If it is lower than 10, you also become sickened. For those sickened already, please turn around your card. You've just become nauseated.
Gather initiative, put cards on the DM screen and describe that there are two extra parties involved. Turn them around so only you can read the contents. They are A-track and B-track. Then tell them that the first secret creature gets a surprise round. Describe the following.
> You look around. A rumbling approaches you. On the train track across from yours, you see the middle track start to crackle with lightning arcs. One goon that stands on it is met with sparks as he immediatly collapses on the ground. The other orcs start to stumble towards your track, as the train rushes by. One goon is not on time and SPLATTERS across the caverns.
> 
> That's the end of the surprise round. (Turn around the cards, reveal track A and track B, write it down on the flipmat.
#### Fight
Describe them as a metal band called the Noise Boys:
- Morg the lieutenant (page 166) is the lead
- Korg and Lorg the sergeants (page 166) are resp the guitarist and base guitarist
- Jorg the mystic (167) is the grunge singer
- Caleb the war drummer (p168) is the drummer.
- the third rail on each track requires a DC 4 reflex save to dodge, it does 8d10 lightning damage.
- A card with A track on one side will turn around at the end of its turn, during it's turn the train that is shown to the players will rush by.

> As the final orc falls to the ground, you start hearing a jumble of high pitched voices echoeing through the tunnels. Twitchy, quick and skittery sounds accompany the chattering. You hear one voice calling "The Rat King grants you entryyyyyyyyyy!" With a loud screech, turning mechanics on track A start to move the train tracks as a part of the wall opens, revealing a secret tunnel with it's own set of tracks.
### A short respite (II)
> These tracks seem to be unused as you don't need to dodge a train every six seconds. The soft hum of the electrified railings subsume as you leave track A and B behind you. These rails seems to have been unused for eons. As they continue you eventually run into a part where most the the tracks are covered with stone, as if a small rockslide occured here. To your left a piece of the wall has been carved out, creating a small resting place only ten feet deep. In the center of the area, a rope hangs from the ceiling.
> 
> Perception check:
> 
> - 10, the rope isn't affixed to anything, it just hangs from the ceiling
> - 15, the rope is made of seemingly hemp material and is 30 feet long, it is of surprising quality considerin the time it must've been here.
> - 20, the rope has tiny golden strands woven into the pattern
> - 25, the part of the ceiling that the rope touches is gently shimmering.
