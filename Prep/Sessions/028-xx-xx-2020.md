Floor 2:
A fight! Four Orgres, see stats in Roll20
Floor 3:
Players are teleported to the middle of a weird pattern:
So you have decided to continue your attempt at twarting us? Why do you insist of protecting life as you know it when you just as easily kill four Ogres. Why is it that you adhere to life only when it suits you. With the dragon gone, we may be without an heir, true, but we are also unshackled. We will raze through this forest like a fire, and from it's ashes we will revere mordremoth and the nightmare. And for us to do that we will have to take down your mother, petal.. by.. petal...
