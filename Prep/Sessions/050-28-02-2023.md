# 050 - 28-02-2023
# Intro
Sent out by the dubious Hirm Graham into the depts underneath the Ulfloch, Lozano Vicerion, Meow N'one and Thaddeus Nightheart fought their way through the dark corners of this underground keep. Despite the stories, it turned out the plundered depths were not as emptied out as predicted. Dark turning pits, cursed architects and a pool filled to the rim with living eyeballs were not enough to deter these heroes on their quest to find the captured Lady Fightmount, member of the Arcadian council, supervisor of the Ouroboros investigation and bequeather of the Ringkeep. It was Lady umbra and her pet fiend AgadÃ»l that had taken her. Yes, Lady Umbra, once known as the young and innocent Thindar Holstice, a softspoken herbalist of the Ringkeep and secret paramour of Hobbs. She and their newborn daughter had dissapeared during the first night of Darkness that befell the Ringkeep. No one expected her to take this sudden of a change of heart, and lead a doomsday cult to the capture of Lady Fightmount and the acquisition of the powers of Agathor, brother of Agadul.
Yes, the Demon Twins. Agadul and Agathor. Legends predicted that they carry the force of might that their father, the demon lord of Wrath, Gruumsh once held. A power which was divided among them. These same legends foretold that if their powers would one day be united, vile evils would befall the world, as a great seal would be undone. A seal that was bound in blood, Gruumsh's blood. Despite having enslaved Agadul, and having acquired the essence of Agathor after raiding Deepstone, Umbra has not rained this hell down on Siressea yet. It is yet unclear what Umbra's goals are, but what is crystal clear is that, for the safety of the people of these lands, she must be stopped. No matter the cost they have to pay.
# Final room description and speech
As the door opens, a dark green fog escapes from the opening, a fog not unfamilliar to you. The stench of death welcomes you as you realize that you haven't yet cleared all changing pits in this foul hole in the ground.
> Description of room if unseen
> 
> This large hall is unlike the pit you've seen before. Intricate tiling on the floor, roof and walls of this area. A square hole in the ground which fills about half of it is emanating the green fog, like giant witches' cauldron. Shivers run down your neck as you are reminded of the Hags of Felbrook. Torches hang around the hall, flickering a bright and unnatural flame. Spread across the room are poles, about a meter high, extruding from the ground. It is unclear what their function is. Directly opposite of you, on the other end of the pit, is an elevated altar. On this altar stands a lectern with a black-leathered tome upon it. In front of the lectern, facing, but not noticing you, is Umbra. This time with her hood down you immediately recognize Thindar's face. Tied diagonally across her torso hangs a light blue cloth, with something seemingly wrapped in it. Floating behind her is a large humanoid skull, adorned with several bright pink crystals seemingly embedded at random in the bone. Agadul is nowhere to be seen. As Umbra is muttering to herself, reading from the Tome, she looks up the the ceiling at the center of the room. A chain, hung to a hook in the ceilingtiles, is wrapped around a female human figure dressed in a blue robe. You recognise this woman as Lady Fightmount, she seems to be unconscious.

> Playlist: Scene - Intrigue (the Nier Song)
> 
> It is typical of you rats to show up during the moment of truth. I assumed I would not always be one step ahead of you but it bitters me that that fool Graham was the one to give you the edge to find me down here. It is however too late! Your precious lady hangs above the precipice and the only one capable of preventing her doom is me, so you shall do as I say or the lady perishes.
> 
> [Umbra looks around and stares blankly at the floating skull] Yes, the moment of truth. For centuries have we been planning this, yet when all would pay off, it was taken from us. From the moment I opened my eyes to the life of this meek herbalist, I realized I could not escape my fate. I would need to claw my way out of this cursed cycle and plotted our return, the preparations I already had set in motion were still turning their cogs. During this third night of darkness, I shall bind the power of Agathor to my soul and take them to a body capable of harnessing both. [She looks back to Fightmount] Yes, your precious lady Fightmount shall do well as a host. All the pieces shall be put into place.
> 
> [She looks at you directly now] But I've grown tired of our games. After all this time you still know nothing and to nothing you shall go. You already lost one ringkeeper, allow me the courtesy of finishing the job. The time for idle entertainment has passed, I bear no intention to show you the destination of my path. Boris, hide while I show these peons what true suffering means.
> 
> [She moves aside some of the cloth on her torso, reavealing what was swaddles inside it, a baby, eyes open, staring intently at you, not making a peep. With one long finger Umbra touches the forehead of the child, as a magical energy seems to transmit between them. She closes the cloth again and faces you.] NOW, LET US END THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL.
# Fight
The players shall fight Umbra in an arena of her making.
Boris the Demilich shall go invisible, give a hint that he went invisible but it still in the room.
The room is a large ring with several poles emanating from the ground all across the room and a large pit in the middle. This room does not feature any wailing humans but the rumbling of the undead can be heard. During her first round, Umbra will summon a large dark orb in the middle of the room, which seems to be charging. Umbra holds a dagger in one hand, as she touched the pearl on the handle she blinks to one of the corners and holds one of the poles. The smoke from the pit is flowing more abundant.
Features of this bossfight:
- Each turn the orb will pulse a pull spell towards the players. They must make a save or be moved one square towards the orb. It is a reflex save or a constitution save DC 20, but the players can roll with advantage if they are holding a pole.
- After one turn the chain will start lowering fightmount towards the pit. The mechanism is inside the ceiling. A disable device DC 25 will stop it from turning. 
    - The chain is cold iron, it has an HP of 20 and a hardness of 10, AC of 2. Players must find out a way to break it without harming the lady.
- Boris is aimlessly floating around the room. Give him initiative as well and make sure that the players know that he is taking a turn as well each time. He can be found if the players use detect magic for three rounds or if they get make a perception check DC 30. The skull is idle and doesn't fight back.
- Battle end conditions: 
    - Chain is stopped or lady is saved.
    - Boris is taken captive by the players.
    - Holstice is killed or incapacitated
If the fight ends and the baby is alive and held by one of the players, explain that her cloth has the name Marie Holstice embroidered into it. Ask the other players to leave the room and do a one on one RP encounter with the player. Lady Dusseaux, Umbra, is inside the baby, not Thindar, and will try to enthrall the player holding her. Will save DC15. If she succeeds, the player is taken over by the mind of Umbra, let them read the backstory and tell them to RP her as she wishes. Explain her goal that she wants to fuse Agaduls power with the demilich to rouse Boris from his sleep.
