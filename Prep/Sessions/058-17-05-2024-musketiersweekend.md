## Room 2
> You walk down the old musty staircase and wild into a room brightly lit with sheet white fluorestent lighting.
## Room 3
Final boss room, describe a ritual circle drawn out in blood on the floor. A dc spellcraft check reveals that this circle binds a demonic entity. Several candles burn on the side. On the wall it is scrawled:
> Break the circle and break the binding. The howling one shall return. To those brave enough: First traverse each room and decipher its flaws before unleashing the howling one or die as fools. It cannot see, it cannot hear, it cannot leave.
Three doors lead to three separate rooms, symbols lining the door. One room has two theatre masks but both are crying. One has a large eye above it. The last has a guillotine above it.
Weakness 1 - The Helmet of maddening screams: Woof has a bone helmet that continually whispers evil thoughts into its mind, Woof can´t hear anything outside of the skull (hardness 10; HP 30).
Weakness 2 - The Eyes of Praalor: Woof has burning gems for eyes that can be doused with water. They cause Woof to see everything in a distorted manner.
Weakness 3 - The Collar of Binding: Woof wears a spiked collar that forces it to follow two commands: Kill all and burn all. Saying the words; Klaatu barada nikto, loosens it.
The DC for animal handling to calm and tame Woof is 30; lowering by five for each succesful removal of the weaknesses mentioned above.
## Room 4
A room full of skull shaped helmets. Putting one on makes the wearer hear loud screams. DC's appropriately to remove them.
## Room 5
A large fountain with glistening water
## Room 6
A statue of a collared cerberus with a name plaque for each head in celestial. Klaatu, Barada and Nikto. A tome describes the existence of a hound that had two commands: Kill all and burn all. Only when the gods called out their names would the hound retreat from its rampage
# Woof (Nessian Hell Hound)
*This creature resembles a powerfully built wolf the size of a large elephant, with ebony fur and burning, fiery red eyes.*
