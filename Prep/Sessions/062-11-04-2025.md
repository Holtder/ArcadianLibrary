# Intro
After surviving the debacle during the train cart explosion underneath the city of Oph, our heroes find themselves led into a secret cavern that by some extreme, inscrutable coÃ¯ncidence appeared right where they fought off the stragglers of the cart. Guided by the skittering of a thousand invisible rats and the scratching voice of one who calls himself the rat king. Now, our heroes don't have the time do dwell on trivial matters, such as "Why did this door open up exactly where we were" or "Who left this strange interdimensional rope behind for us to so easily take". What they did figure out though, is that the subways may be in close connection to the undersump, another layer of the Abyss more aligned to Jubilex, the Demon Prince of Sloth.
Now, the heroes venture on, as they go on further into the dungeon. As they further venture into.. The Den
> You continue walking into subway tunnel, you quickly see some light at the end, as a large hall seems to be located at the end of the tunnel.
# Dungeon Layout
The goal of this session is to introduce the mechanic of the dungeon. It is to gather several runic stones that each apply a different effect. The dungeon is a collection of several rooms, some boss fights, other puzzles. In the central chamber is a large statue of a Rat King, with each rat having a socket between its eyes where runestones can be kept. The stones offer several effects, making other rooms easier, but all need to be slotted into the statue to continue.
The first room of the dungeon is a subway graveyard. Several skeletons line the area, as do dead and rotting animals. Most of the room cannot be seen as a stack of train carts are in the way. In the centre of the area a large blast seems to have blown away the remains of a large campsite in between the trains, which - along with their rails - have been blown away (perception and survival track DCs to check out the remains. An item of great power was set off, the players need to figure out that these people were the owners of the rope. Some shrapnel is lodged into the ceiling, with a satchel hanging off of it. Inside of it is a 1 foot wide stone with a rune carved into it. In the distance is a tunnel leading on, but its opening is completely filled with an abandoned, yet intact train locomotive. Inside of it is an engine that takes a runestone to be put inside of it.
Part of the puzzle is finding out about the satchel, another is finding out how it works. the owner needs to trace his fingers along the rune, when the stone starts to glow bright. The longer it is held, the stronger it grows. Once let go a modified fireball spell is cast from the back end of the stone:
> #### Runic fireball (X is seconds held)
> 
> When the stone is activated by running a finger along the rune, it wil charge until the finger is removed from the stone. A fireblast will appear in a X*5 feet cone, doing Xd6 damage. Reflex save 20 halves damage.
The previous owners accidentally found themselves holding it for too long, being unable to let go, which went wrong.
Putting the stone in the socket and activating it causes the train to run, leading them to the central chamber. The central chamber has several elevated stone railings, connected by an elevated rotating train platform in the center, leading onto the 10 separate tracks into ten large stone doors, each with a runed socket on it, clearly requiring certain stones to be opened. The rotating platform is standing on a statue of 10 giant rats, connected with their tails in a knot. Each rat also has a socket in between its eyes. Socketing the rat does nothing for now, socketing the door opens it.
First room:
the first room cannot be entered by train, as the socket is requiered to open (and keep open the first door). It is a boss fight.
