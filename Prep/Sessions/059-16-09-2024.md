#### Investigating Tarrok's room
Things to find out:
- There are two letters on Mortar's body.
- Mortar has been seen going to the pits with Alan
- The body hasn't evaporated into coins, upon closer inspection there is a stack of coins in the center of his chest cavity.
- On high enough skill checks, the players find out that the body of Mortar is one of a shapeshifter demon.
#### Journey to the pits to find Gutsnarl
In the pits describe many souls that seem to have lost limbs, or show sings of missing organs. One doesn't have a mouth and by result looks emaciated. Another one is jaundiced and clearly drunk, as it turns out they gave up their liver and have been drinking at a later stage, their body is unable to purge the alcohol and they are perpetually drunk. Either by asking around for Gutsnarl or by asking for around for splicing they find his shack.
#### Speaking to Gutsnarl
Explain splicing. Lead into fight from several human-demon hybrids. Draw a room with multiple surgeon's tables, adorned with circle saws, hacksaws, sowing kits and more. Three Vrock Demons (B1-69) battle them.
