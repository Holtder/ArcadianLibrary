## Intro
After protecting Felbrook from the Hags of Umbra, something peculiar was happening to Meow. His powers had started to drain, as visions of the past called him back to his home, Baltica. During their travels a storm rises, it's lightning-strikes dancing around the party. The two most recent additions to the group, Marcus and Sheddy, throw off their riders and bolt off into the distance. One final lightlingbolt strikes the earth, through the skull of Meow. In a dream voices from the past call out for Meow. He must choose and right what has been wronged in the past. Once awake, the halfling realises that his old powers have completely vanished, as his connection to nature has been reformed to a one with the elements specifically the element of air. Unsure what to do next, the party continues onward along the road. On their way, they trick a group of bridge trolls and meet a traveling family from the valley of the five winds. With them, the Ringkeepers share many stories about their pasts and futures alike.
The next morning, the heroes say goodbye to their new friends, who are headed the other way, and move on. We left off last time just a mile outside of Baltica, is there anything you want to do or say before we start?
[...]
As you step on, you see a small wooden arch above the road, three words decorate it, one word in gnomish, one in halfling, the third in common. All three say; Baltica. Past it you see the sunny hills, with a handful of small homes and huts dotting them. To your right a farmer is tending to his crops, it is a diverse collection of root vegetables such as carrots, sweet potatoes, onions and turnips. The man initially doesn't notice you, but at one point, when he decides to wipe the sweat from his forehead, he looks up and catches you eyes.
> Ah, visitors, we dinnea get a lot of ye around here, names Surin Mossrun! Me an' my wife make sure everyone around here stays nice and fat. How about ye, hope ye bring nuthin but peace?
## Prep
The players want to inquire what happened two years ago. This is in short terms what happened:
- The town became too big, too many watermills had started to work too hard. The waters became disturbed and a plan was signed to build five more watermills deep into the moors.
- The waterspirits of the rivers, tasked with the safe passage of the lost souls, found that the souls could not properly calm down and were unable to pass on, fouling the moors even more.
- As an attempt to counteract this, the water spirits summoned a creature that would find those responsible and kill them. Unfortunately this creature was not selective in it's targeting and killed nearly anyone in Baltica
- The creature finally found the parents of Meow and killed them and the whole family.
- When the water spirits found out about the loss of life they had caused they mourned, all inhabitants of Baltica that had died were granted safe passage, except for the Hamuur family.
- The souls of the parents were shattered into five crystal shards, the shards were then filled with the souls of the children.
- The spirits then sent out the shards out into the world by giving one to a seagull spirit, one to a fish spirit, one to a dog spirit (the dog of the Hamuur family that was watching over them and failed to protect them) and one to a water spirit that ventured out into the world. The fifth shard was given to the creature that razed the town (hydrodaemon B2) as payment.
- The hydrodaemon fled to somewhere unknown but the dog is bound to the Moors.
Today the players will get familiar with the town, gather clues, and start on their first expedition into the Moors.
Narratively over the arc I want to do the following:
- Explore town, give some hint that the peace of the Moors are disturbed, give hints of a howling creature in the forests.
- First trip into the Moors - At night the Moors are filled with lost souls (ghosts) that wander the fields, seemingly blind to their surroundings, asking for help, as they can't see anything. One spirit, near the treehouse is angry, it is the wife of Calgrim Gallard; Marionne.( 
    - Fight the damned spirit; give the impression that the lost souls are the cause of the distubance. They live around the treehouse.
- When back in town, gather more information about the history of Baltica, especially the P'thumera and their connection with the rivers.
- Second trip into the Moors - Fight more spirits of the damned, see a large wolf like creature take off into the distance. (This is Woof)
- Back in town, learn about the Druma, their struggle with the gnomes and the peace they found with eachother
- Final trip into the Moors, fight Woof and the Hydrodaemon.
Encounter:
## Conversation points with hinto
- Hinto won't open the door that easily and needs to be convinced first, especially because she thinks that Meow is one of the souls from the Moors as she thinks he died.
- Once convinced, Hinto will explain that she is long descendent of the P'thumora tribe. She won't want to explain all of it yet.
- The players need to prove that they have the best in mind for the Moors.
- If they pass the challenge Hinto will explain the following 
    - Long ago the P'thumore tribe looked over these lands, it is supposed that they build the stones that surround the area. With the technology they had back then it is curious how they were able to build in such straight lines.
    - At one point, the indoustrious Druma halflings landed on the shores to the east, where the port is now located.
    - Each generation a P'thumoran and a Druma are tasked with looking over the Moors, for it carries a sacred task.
    - Her partner, a halfling that lived the hut to the east, died of sickness X years before the massacre.
    - Due to this, she was not attuned anymore for
- Afterwards, she will perform a ritual; for it she leads the group to the basement and will use her cauldron as a catalyst. 
    - For it she requires some hair of Meow.
    - She will warn that she does not know wat lies waiting on the other end, other parties may be watching.
    - During the ritual, she shall say the following: 
        - "Spirits of the Moors, those of the recently lost and the long forgotten, this young man has escaped the fate that designed for him and forget his own. What is it that binds you to this place, what is it that
        - Voices are heard, that hint at the shattering of glass.
        - Two spirits are bound to the moors. 
            - One stranger, bound by contract, the one who did the massacre (the hydrodaemon) 
                - The stranger spirit appears as water in the shape of a hydrodaemon.
                - It is in hiding for its fate, intertwined with the Moors.
            - One local spirit, fallen victim to the water, bound to the moors by love, waiting to pass on it's task to it's master. 
                - The local spirit appears in the shape of water, it is a raggedy dog, it is Woof.
                - It roams the Moors, looking for it's master.
- The ritual will abruptly end
- Hinto will explain: we have two more nights of full moon left. Go into the Moors tonight and find the spirit of poor Woof, release him from his suffering and return what binds him to this place. With that we may find the other spirit.
