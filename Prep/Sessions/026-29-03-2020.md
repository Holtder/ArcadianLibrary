## Intro
It came as a shock, when one of the Ringkeepers, Tarok, revealed to his friends that he grew up in one of Siressea's most notorious guilds; the nightshade guild.
You see, Tarok had received a letter from his old mentor; Brandir.
It summoned him to the Lotaari forest; woodlands that cover the entire northeast coast of Siresea.
Tarok did not explain himself, but he implored his friends: We need to go there and we need to go now.
And so they did, using the Arcadian Network's Portal system, they arrived at Thieves End at the same day.
Here, a couple revelations revealed themselves:
- Tarok had a sister at some point, Scara, who was believed to be dead.
- Brandir has reasons to believe Scara is still alive. Not only that, but she is the bodyguard of her supposed murderer, Ra'dok!
- She was seen entering the Lotaari Forest a few days ago; where she went afterwards, no-one knows.
So the mission was as follows, meet up with a contact of Brandir in the Forest. While preparing for their depart, the party roams around Thieves End and learns a thing or two about the forest. Many types species live in the forest, some of them have chosen to create alliances. These alliances are the Nightmare Court and the Guardians of the Forest. Endless turmoil between these groups started after a dragon arrived in the forest, immediately falling to a long slumber. Recently the dragon has been slain and tensions arise once more.
The party enters the forest, leaving Argentus and Tesh behind.

### First Hour
Just after the fight let Tesh appear behind them. Apparently Argentus "could smell them, those snake-eyed bastards" and dashed into the forest. Knowing what Brandir said, she followed the path and found the party. But Argentus was nowhere to be found.
Argentus wil sometimes respond to earring callouts, but only when it is not suspicious to his captors.
Hints he will give:
- A long tunnel lead to this gigantic hole
- Follow the roots with glowy veins
- The tree people took me
After following the path, they will find a treehouse from which a flute can be heard:
- The Faun Greshwick lives here. 
    - He was once part of a traveling circus, but got thrown out after sleeping with the Director's daughter
    - He is not part of any alliance, but keeps good relationships with both of them
    - He can explain the history of the forest and the two alliances.
    - He knows that a certain group of people are trading with the molemen of both alliances.
- Will explain the route to the Grove or the Twilight Arbor, IF the players can answer three riddles.
- Riddle 1: 
    - What is it-
    - That we love more than life,
    - Fear more than death,
    - The rich want it,
    - The poor have it,
    - The hoarder spends it,
    - And the spend-rift saves it?
    - Answer: Nothing
- Riddle 2: 
    - What runs around a city but never moves?
    - Answer: A Wall
- Riddle 3: You may only try one answer! 
    - So eternal, the ground underneath us
    - So old is the turmoil that may never suss
    - So do we protect is, the waking world of yore,
    - So do we fight, for the dream that haunts us to our core
    - So tell me I promise not to get furious
    - The Court or the Guardians, who will be victorious?
Depending on what the players say, Greshwick will send them to the home of either Alliance.
The Grove is the home of the Guardians of the Forest, a cave with blue-veined roots leads to a remote island below sea level (walled with a thin mountain ridge). Both alliances consist of wood-elves, dryad, ratkin and molemen.
DM-note, the idea is that wherever the party goes, that is where Argentus is taken to.
### Second Hour
The trip towards the city of choice
The players follow the route and will reach a crossroads, left is the Grove, right is the Twillight Arbor. On the road they get surrounded by three Kamadans:
