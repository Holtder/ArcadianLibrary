# Overview
The players will have to prove their own innocence by finding the real killer of Mikhael Embergrave. The first clue is the carriage driver, as they ask around town they'll hear that a man fitting the description has been seen lurking around town. The last place he's been seen was around the chapel. The priestess (Veyra there) will give them two leads after a bit of interrogation:
- Ferdinant is a ruthless man and a shrewd business man, maybe he had something to do with it.
- Evils lurk in the caverns, maybe the family is cursed.

# Introduction
Jacob Monaghue, the gun toting priest, Ravenar Grime, the man with the heir of a noble, but lacking the usual horns and Thaldin Swiftstrike, the headstrong monk with the social aptitude of a falling anvil, met each other by chance on a cabbie headed for the city of Tiressea. Their travels were interrupted, however, as their horse drawn carriage sped up and crashed into a signpost right in front of Gully Hill. Guards quickly arrived and as some were helping these men out, another opened the trunk of the carriage, and found the desiccated body of sweet Mikhael, a young lordling of House Embergrave, second son of the cunning Lord Hieran Embergrave, nephew to the pious Veyra Embergrave and brother to stern Ferdinant Embergrave. You were taken in and questioned by the captain's guard, Varn Delk and member of the [[Inquisitorious Rex]], Sister Halvine.

Unconvinced of your involvement, Captain Varn Delk decided on an unorthodox method of investigation, let the poor sods prove their own innocence, or stay under the Embergrave employ for life. After some discussion amongst you, you set off to explore the several leads you had. At the tavern you learned that the Deepcut mines, property of House Embergrave, we're recently modernized with lent money from the Tiressean Railway Company, or the TRC, but soon afterwards were closed down due to a monstrous infestation. This had put a strain on both the noble family and the townsfolk, as everyone feels the axe of fate swinging above their head, unsure when it would drop. You would later see this confirmed when you fought off thieves of a local store who turned out to be the disgruntled youth of town. You went out and spoke with Veyra, priestess of the God-Queen Veyra, where she explains more about the inner workings of the Embergrave House. Lord Hieran is out of town for business, but unfortunately missed Sister Halvine appearing. While claiming to be here for routine reasons, the message is clear, the Queen reinforces that the TRC wants its money back. She makes it clear, Ferdinant is a cutthroat willing to hurt anyone on his path to consolidate power.

Following up on that lead was more complicated then you expected, you ran into the Lordling and incument ruler himself, and Ferdinant turned out to be everything you've been told about him and more. His anger towards you was boundless. Using the distraction of a fire suddenly breaking out at the church of the God Queen, the rogues investegated a bit more at the back of the manor and entered Hieran's study by breaking the lock in the door. In there you found out that not all you've learned about Ferdinant Embergrave was true, Ferdinant loved his brother above anything else. With this new information you've been able to soothe his fury just enough that he allowed you to inspect the remains of Mikhael. The monstrous wounds on his body told all you needed to know, the next step of your investigation lies in the Deepcut mines. Two conversations further with an old miner, Raskin Drude and ex-engineer Old Crank Jabin, you learn that your goals lay at the upper levels of the Deepcut mines, and if you're there anyway, check out the Shimmerstone!

This is where we left off, in the ruckus of a crowded tavern in a dwindling mining town, sitting at your own table, finishing your ale. 

Notes to self:
- Halvine is FURIOUS the church has been set afire
