# Overview
The players will have to prove their own innocence by finding the real killer of Mikhael Embergrave. The first clue is the carriage driver, as they ask around town they'll hear that a man fitting the description has been seen lurking around town. The last place he's been seen was around the chapel. The priestess (Veyra there) will give them two leads after a bit of interrogation:
- Ferdinant is a ruthless man and a shrewd business man, maybe he had something to do with it.
- Evils lurk in the caverns, maybe the family is cursed.

Ferdinant will prove to be quite harsh but clearly loves his brother and feels great anger for the murder of his sibling. He'll hate the players with a passions and thinks it

## Introduction
*Song: first three songs of Wrath of the Righteous OST*

Somewhere to the northeast lay a city, larger than any city ever stood on these lands, with castle spires reaching above the clouds. A city of stone, a city of cast iron, a city of gargoyles, a city lowly dredges and a city of noblemen. Class and deceit divide the people of this terrible and great city, where the common folk fight for survival under the harsh rule of their Queen and her Nobles. Downtrodden and soaked with rain, they walk the muddy paths and cross the soot stained market square, some pass a stern looking man in a burgundy coat with high collars reaching up to his jawline, his hair is jet black with a few white streaks going along the back.  Standing on a small platform, he cups his large hands in front of his mouth as he shouts out to the crowd. Beset on either side of him are two imposing knights, clad in large, dark plate armor and horned helmets. All three of them wear the same golden sigil of the queen on their chest, a bejeweled skull. The sigil of the God Queen.

> Here ye here ye for all who wish to hear! All hail God Queen Dusseaux, saviour of us all. Sibling and emissary of the Gods themselves, her royal majesty flew down from the skies with her holy army of Tieflings to the Tiressean king and from his lands, freed the world of Arcadian tiranny! Within years, gone was the council! Gone were the pagan heretics of the forest and gone were those filthy desert dwellers. She brought rule and order to these chaotic lands. She united the lands to form one country, Siressea! The old kingdoms were abolished and from the newly founded capital, Tiressea,  her holyness rules with justice and love. Her beloved kin, the Tiressean Noble houses ensure that you, the common folk, follow the way of life the Gods intended for us all! Her great plan will deliver us from evil and protect us from those from the deep, from the detestible Uligorians!

> Follow the law, serve the queen and know your place in this world, these three tenets will cause our lands to prosper! Have her quarries not given you stone to build your houses? Have her armies not given you the warmth of security! Have her factories not created the vapor engine and black powder that lightens your burdens? Sure, follow thy own gods to your own pleasure, but beware! Old texts may have been altered by pagans, rebels may sway your mind to evil thoughts! Many may claim to know the divine, but merely one person down in this mortal world may interpret the word of the gods, and that is our immortal Queen!

> You, yes you young man! You seem an aimless dweller in life, if your journey has no destination yet, join the Holy Army of your liege! Maybe you will become a builder, working on the coastal wall, or maybe you'll become a crusader, spreading the word of the Queen by word and mace! Perhaps you'll join the inquisitorius, silencing her foes and quelling rebelions! Whatever you may become, you shall have a place in the great plan. Join our fight for a safe and prosperous Siressea and most importantly, fight for the love that you have for your queen.

> **ALL HAIL THE GOD-QUEEN, DEATH TO THE PAGANS, DEATH TO THE REBELLION!!**

A bird looking down from one of the many stone statues decorating the walls and edges of the houses, cocks her head at the sight below, not understanding what is happening beneath her. She takes a shit on the statue and flies off, out of the city, away from the soot, away from the sweat. She flies for days, looking for a place to find a mate and maybe brood some younglings. She lands on the branches of a tree overlooking a long and winding road. A horse-drawn carriage passes as it takes three curious figures towards that same village. If she could read, she would understand the sign on the side of the carriage, she would know it said "Capital Cabbie", but alas, she is a bird and does not understand these things. So she lands on the roof of the carriage, resting and hitching a ride, unbeknowst that it's final destination is whence she came from. The carriage driver and his horse slowly trot forward. Long past sunset, something curious happens. The carriage driver hops off, but lets the horse continue. He smacks it's hind and the horse bolts off, taking the cart with it. The bird only just manages to hold on, until the cart crashes into a small wooden post. A sign nailed into it reads "Welcome to Gully Hill." 

Then the bird flies off, leaving the human affairs to the humanoids, for such a small creature has no sway in these events. Guards arrive as the confused passengers get out. They explain what happened to one of the guards as another opens up the coffer of the carriage to inspect is. A body is found, accusations are made, and before they know it. The three are taken. 

___

Jacob, you wake up in a cold cell, you ache as you pull yourself up from the cold, hard floor, which is not easy considering you are bound by black iron manacles. A comfortable warmth soothes you as it emanates from your back. You feel around for your holster, fuck, it's empty. In the dark you can barely discern the iron bars in front of you. You hear shuffling from the cells to either side of you, but you can't see their inhabitants.

What do you do?

## Chapter 1: the prison

![[Locations and NPCs#The Gully Hill Guardpost]]

The players are taking into interrogation one by one by Jorren. They enter to find local guardsman Captain Varn Delk and state inquisitor Sister Halvine at the opposite side of the table. Have them introduce themselves a bit. Make sure that the players realise that the interrogation room can be heard from the cells, unbeknownst to the Guards.

At the end they'll be let out with special unremovable wristbands carrying the sigil of House Embergrave, burning coal in a skeletal hand. They'll be slaves and can't leave town, lest they be returned to town by inquisitors, or worse, killed.

## Chapter 2: Rumors in Gully Hill

Have the players roam around town a bit. Maybe they explore the tavern or go to the Sootmarket. In the end, they'll hear about the carriage driver, who the players remember to look like a bald, small and fat man with crooked teeth, almost a caricature. He was seen around the chapel

## Chapter 3: An Ambush!
On the way to the [[Locations and NPCs#The Embergrave Chapel of the God-Queen]], the players will be walking along the [[Locations and NPCs#The Sootmarket]] past the [[Locations and NPCs#Tallow & Flint Trading Post]]. As they pass, a loud crashing sound can be heard from the Tallow & Flint, as three figures jump out of the broken window and Berrick comes running out after. 

> **Berrick:** Stop these damn hooligans! They've taken our money! 
> *You see him looking around and fix his gaze at one person in the crowd, Jorren Pike, the wee guardsman you met when you woke up in the prison. The comes a moment in everyones life where they must man up, where they show their mettle and make a decision. A choice to act then and there. For Jorren, this is not that moment, as his knees buckle and he clearly had to use his spear ot hold himself upward. Berrick looks around at the crowd.*
> **Berrick:** Won't anyone help?!

### Fight: The three thieves
These three thieves are young miners who decided enough was enough, they plan on taking the loot and leaving town. They wear hooded robes and shawls obfuscating their face. These miners try to fight and escape at the same time. 

Rella Brumhide (cunning quartermaster VC166); HP 25, init 15
Tovin Marr (crusty cook VC166); HP29, init 7
Jannik “Janks” Orswell (crusty cook VC166); HP29, init 7

Reward from Berrick if they recover the money (a pouch containing 700gp): 50gp each.
Also: even if they are thieves, these are still locals, children of beloved members of the community, sparing their lives will have a positive effect on the reputation of the players.
## Chapter 4: Interrogating the Priestess
![[Locations and NPCs#The Embergrave Chapel of the God-Queen]]

She appears as a **middle‑aged human woman**, humble, tired, devout. 
Voice: stern, deferential to authority, "I mean no trouble, I only serve to the queen"

She never initiates lies — she lets the players’ assumptions guide her answers.
- **Deflect suspicion** away from the chapel and herself.  
- **Plant doubt** about Ferdinant; “You should ask Ferdinant… he was furious that day.”
- She saw the carriage driver near the chapel, praying for safe travels.  
- She heard shouting from the direction of the station later that night.  
- She noticed Mikhael seemed troubled lately  
- Locals think the mines are cursed, she doesn't know. God-queen protect us..

Deny: 
- Any connection to Mikhael aside from being cousins, long removed from family when joining the church 
- Any knowledge of the murder.  
- Any involvement with the mines.  
- Any knowledge of the carriage’s route or timing.  
- Anything about her bloodline or the Embergraves.
If pressed, she becomes emotional, not defensive — she plays the victim.

Usable quotes
- **Feign fear**: “Please, I don’t want trouble. I only serve the Queen.”  
- **Use piety as a shield**: “The God‑Queen teaches us to speak only truth.”  
- **Ask questions back** to gather intel: “Did they find the real killer?”  

## Chapter 5: An audience with the lordling
The players will recieve an invitation to meet with Ferdinant in the hall of the Embergrave manor. They will be grilled, reveal slowly that Ferdinant loves his brother. Have it be interrupted by the guards telling them the church is on fire! Ferdinant will now believe their innocence, but the townsfolk have seem the players there just before the fire.
## Chapter 6: To the mines!
![[Locations and NPCs#The Deepcut Mines]]

As the players reach the dungeon, have them interact with a frustrated foreman, monsters have destroyed the elevator going downstairs to the actual mines, engineers are coming in from the capital, but the monsters need to be gone by then. This confirms it for him, they've dug too deep, the caverns have become cursed.


![[Deepcut Mines]]
## Chapter 7: A mystery revealed & final fight
Depends on what the players did with it, but if possible have the final fight in the banquet hall in between the long dining tables. Have two of her acolytes turn into Fevered Raveners (undead ghasts)

Veyra Embergrave - Awakened Voice VC 72 - HP 48, init 19
Acolyte 1 - VC 73 - HP 24, init 12
Acolyte 2 - VC 73 - HP 24, init 6
