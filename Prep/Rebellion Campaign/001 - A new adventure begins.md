## Introduction
Somewhere to the northeast lay a city, larger than any city ever stood on these lands, with castle spires reaching above the clouds. A city of stone, a city of cast iron, a city of gargoyles, a city lowly dredges and a city of noblemen. Class and deceit divide the people of this terrible and great city, where the common folk fight for survival under the harsh rule of their Queen and her Nobles. Downtrodden and soaked with rain, they walk the muddy paths and cross the soot stained market square, some pass a stern looking man in a burgundy coat with high collars reaching up to his jawline, his hair is jet black with a few white streaks going along the back.  Standing on a small platform, he cups his large hands in front of his mouth as he shouts out to the crowd. Beset on either side of him are two imposing knights, clad in large, dark plate armor and horned helmets. All three of them wear the same golden sigil of the queen on their chest, a bejeweled skull. The sigil of the God Queen.

> Here ye here ye for all who wish to hear! All hail God Queen Dusseaux, saviour of us all. Sibling and emissary of the Gods themselves, her royal majesty flew down from the skies with her holy army of Tieflings to the Tiressean king and from his lands, freed the world of Arcadian tiranny! Within years, gone was the council! Gone were the pagan heretics of the forest and gone were those filthy desert dwellers. She brought rule and order to these chaotic lands. She united the lands to form one country, Siressea! The old kingdoms were abolished and from the newly founded capital, Tiressea,  her holyness rules with justice and love. Her beloved kin, the Tiressean Noble houses ensure that you, the common folk, follow the way of life the Gods intended for us all! Her great plan will deliver us from evil and protect us from those from the deep, from the detestible Uligorians!

> Follow the law, serve the queen and know your place in this world, these three tenets will cause our lands to prosper! Have her quarries not given you stone to build your houses? Have her armies not given you the warmth of security! Have her factories not created the vapor engine and black powder that lightens your burdens? Sure, follow thy own gods to your own pleasure, but beware! Old texts may have been altered by pagans, rebels may sway your mind to evil thoughts! Many may claim to know the divine, but merely one person down in this mortal world may interpret the word of the gods, and that is our immortal Queen!

> You, yes you young man! You seem an aimless dweller in life, if your journey has no destination yet, join the Holy Army of your liege! Maybe you will become a builder, working on the coastal wall, or maybe you'll become a crusader, spreading the word of the Queen by word and mace! Perhaps you'll join the inquisitorius, silencing her foes and quelling rebelions! Whatever you may become, you shall have a place in the great plan.
