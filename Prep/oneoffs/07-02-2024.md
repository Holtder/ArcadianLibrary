### The Chase
Enemies: Freelance Thief: NPC Codex p147
> Averan, Murray, Taranga, Milik. We're not picking up where we left off last time, instead, we're going to tell another story. Our heroes received notice of a letter being sent from one subject of the Owl King to another, and you've tracked down the mail carriage that is supposed to hold it. The unfortunate part is, that despite your efforts in quickly tracking it down, you were beaten to it! In the distance you saw bandits threaten the stagecoach, tie his wrists together and take off in a hurry.
> (start playlist)
> Almost by instinct, you've ran towards a nearby horsedrawn open carriage, and as Cooper discracts its owner, you four jump on and bolt off. Your horses are fast and you can see the mailcart in the distance.
> Tell me now: which one of you is holding the reins?

```
Check: ride DC 10
	Succeed: distance between cart and players is 30 meters (100ft) 
	Fail: Add 10ft per point beneath 10
```

```
Check: perception
	- Base: The road quickly turns narrow, you see the hills growing steeper to either side until you are carting along the cliffside of a deep canyon filled with trees and foliage.
    - 10: A wide river runs at the bottom
    - 15: The cart up ahead seems to hold four people; two on the bench on the front, one of which is the tied up stagecoach. The other two are on the roof of the cart.
    - 20: They are preparing crossbows!
    - >25: In the far distance you see a stone bridge crossing the canyon at easily hundrets of feet in the air
```

> The mailcart bolts ahead and the thieves have taken notice of your chase! You slowly advance before you hear a whizzing sound in the air.

```
Attacks are vs AC if the party knows of the attack, otherwise it is flat footed
- Crossbow attack 1 (vs driver): +10 (range 19-20) 1d8 damage
- Crossbow attack 1 (vs random): +10 (range 19-20) 1d8 damage
```

> Ok [driver] first has to make a ride check, your distance is [xx] feet, for each point away from ten you wil either close in or lose 10ft. Afterwards everyone gets to take an action, what do you do?

```
Enemy behaviour:
	When players get too close, random packages will be dropped to slow them down.
    If one enemy dies, have the other one grab his bag to see him fumble in it (he is preparing the bomb)
    When the encounter seems to get to an end; describe the following.
```

> As you get closer, you see that the road ahead curves around a bit as the mailcart turns around the corner, you follow and as you turn the corner, you take in your new sights:

```
Check: perception
	- Base: You are greeted by sound of hooves clacking on stonework as you see the large, white stone bridge the now runs underneath you. It crosses the canyon as it crosses what seems to be a 100 meter gap. The cart is bolting on ahead
    - 10: To the left of the bridge is the source of the river, a wide waterfall crashing water down in a volume you've never seen before. as you look down you can't even see the river due to the splashing mist.
    - 15: The mailcart is going more quickly now, as the horses are able to get more grip on the stonework. The thief is preparing something in his bag.
    - 20: It's a bomb!
    - >25: You didn't notice them before (in a hidden in plain sight kind of way), but the coachman seems to be staring at barrels that are placed about halfway along the bridge.
```

## Fall down

> You fall of the cart, the smell of burning wood fills your nose and the shocked screeches of the horses ring your ears. Where you hoped that you would be greeted by the hard impact of stonework against your body, you are only met by a torrent of wind brushing past you as you feel yourself accelerating towards the bottom of the canyon. What do you do?

Have everything fail, give them a strong sense of panic.

Music: play Scene-Puzzle Room; after it is done, ambient dungeon

> Your eyes go dark, and as the light goes, so do gusts of wind around you. While time passes, you never hit the water. Your eyes adjust to the darkness, and you see each other as you are falling down into nothingness. It take a while before you notice, but there are four figures in your line of sight, as you can see EVERYONE of your party, including yourself. A sense of unease comes over you as you see yourself for the first time without using a mirror. Just before you get a moment to grasp this out of body experience, you hear the loud crashing sound of water again, then, nothing.

## Prison room

> A moment passes before you wake up, cold stone lies underneath you all as you get up. You are in a small chamber lined with cobblestone flooring and walls. Small candles light the room.

- Have them move their character sheet to the player to their left.
- Give them a moment to adjust, after a while, an outline of a door will appear on the stonework, carved into it; above it will appear the following text:

> I can help you to rest
> 
> Or to block out the sun
> 
> But unless you're a cyclops
> 
> You'll need more than one

They'll have to walk through with their eyes closed.

## Central chamber

This is where the party will meet an archaeologist, a halfling woman called Hilda. Hilda has parts of her hair missing as she seems to be covered in burn scars. They are returning to Deepstone after a previous encounter here with another party had caused them to release an ancient and terrible evil. Hilda wil happily explain that, now that the evil force is gone, the true archaeology can begin. She used to hire a professional graverobber named Vance but he died in their previous endeavour.

They will explain that they just picked up a glowing Orb known as the Light of Aldor, which caused the door to close behind them with the sign of Ouroboros on it. Using the Light will cause it to open again, but Vance will exclaim that it is a different room!

## Spider room

3x Spider, Giant Black Widow - B2P256; prerolled INIT 19, 18, 4

## Gridroom

You know this from deepstone, Light of Aldor makes the platforms appear. Follow the pattern in the book. Halfway, let some imps appear which fly directly to the players, during their turn, the runes on any platform underneath them starts to turn black. One turn later they will disappear unless the players use the Light of aldor.

Enemies spawned each round:

##  Final room

Have them meet Tosa (Desna's humanoid form) and pause time (specifically Hilde); look at them with sorrowful expression and mention that they are lost puppies, all seems to be wrong. Snap fingers and have them back in their original shape. After a few moments explain that them being here has tangled some ropes that shouldn't have been. After their conversation a monster will appear, kill it and the party will return home.
