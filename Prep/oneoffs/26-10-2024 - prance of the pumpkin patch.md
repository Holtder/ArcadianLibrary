A story takes place during a halloween themed festival named the Prance of the Pumpkin Patch, it takes place in Jaka Itzel, a medium sized village located near a cursed Bog, and the yearly festivities keep the monsters of the Bog at bay. Little to the people know that in this magical place, stories come to life, as the bog feeds on their dreams and turns them into horrid reality. The stories and the festivals of Jaka Itzel both create the demons that haunt the village and protects them from it, as the people believe their rituals protect them, and those beliefs make it so. The players will be told that strange magics are at bay at the Bog, ones that can make even your wildest dreams come true.

## Intro
It's been weeks sinds the massacre of Faren's Rest, where a deranged millitaryman supposedly took his band of mad followers into town and after being graciously hosted by the locals, decided to kill half of the town and traumatise the rest. In the aftermath, few who survived decided to remain there, leaving only a ghost village in its wake. It was only natural, they were without leadership, as the massacre included the townships baron: Rolant Joss and his adoptive daugher, Rose. Rumors turned into stories, and stories turned into fables. These fables scared the folk of the land, people did not dare get out onto the dark roads, as the mad soldier might get to you, take off your head, and replace it with a pumpkin! Our story takes place in a little town that decided that enough was enough, and they set on to seize the night again. Preparations began in Jaka Itzel, there was a festival to be held, and none of the locals were going to be held back by mere stories. Jaka Itzel is a small village, consisting of creatures of many origins. There are of course the humans, the elf, the dwarves, but more enigmatic people have joined this small place, as both pixies and frogfolk started appearing from the bogs and settled near the waters. All of them work day and night to prepare the village for the yearly Prance of the Pumpkin Patch! The buzz of dearly necessary festivities pulls many a visitor, folk from all over over arrive in droves, as do you five. Your carriage trots through the sloppy and muddy paths towards Jaka Itzel, slowly but surely. A rock hidden underneath the mud causes the cart to jumble, and those among you who were sleeping are now shaken to consciousness. Your carriage driver, a human named Fin, looks back at you.
> Hey you, you're finally awake.
He points towards the evening sky, you see a warm orange hue reflecting on the dark clouds as the music welcomes you.
> There it is, Jaka Itzel, quant place to visit during the Prance, gloomy during every other day of the year. Have you heard it is lied directly near a cursed Bog? Many magics are said to play a tune in those rotten woods, some are said to make even your wildest dreams come true! Ah but enough blabbering, I don't think we've had a proper chat this whole ride, why don't you fellows tell me who you are?

## Outline
Introduction 
- Names, descriptions and initiative rolls, definitive for the whole night and put the labels on the DM screen
- Arrive at the festivities. Mayor is speaking
> You see a half-elf woman, about 30 years old in human age, wearing her blond hair in a tight braid and wearing a noblemans suit with fitting hat (remember that hat from commodore Norrington in Pirates?). She is apparently wrapping up her opening speech:
> (...) and with that, let Prance of the Pumpkin Patch festivities begin! Let me remind you all that by the end of the night, I expect al of you to have crafted a mask by the end of the night and to be ready to participate in the prance!

Free time, have the players explore: 
- Ask around about the local magic: get lead to the Bog Keeper at the story circle (see that section)
- Minigames (see the carnival games sheet)
- Explore the outer edges of town: 
    - Pumpkin patch, a large tilling field of hundreds of pumpkins, the outer edge of pumpkins have all been hollowed out and carved into Jack 'o Lanterns, in the middle of that field the prance will take place
- Story Circle: 
    - The Bog Keeper will gladly tell a story about the Mireling, but when pressed, wil say nothing about the Pumpkin Man, and will advise the party not to mention it, it is becoming too big and Jaka Itzel has enough curses and legends to deal with.
    - Other people at the circle will wave away the Keepers suggestion
- Mask making: 
    - Each mask represents an aspect of a folk tale — The Mireling (made of moss), The Bog Whisps (a sheet of cloth draped over one's face), The Grinning Toad (a clay frog face), and now the Pumpkin Man (A Jack O Lantern). Players are allowed to make their own mask.
- Local tavern 
    - See NPC page

After a while, have it seep through that the stories of the pumpkin man are all the hype this year, and the Bog Keeper has been trying to prevent people from spreading the story. The twist is that the Bog turns stories into real horrors. 
- Checks that may weaken the Pumpkin Man: 
    - Tell a good story during the Story Circle that may spread through the village

    - Defeat the creatures in the Arena (they will otherwise be released during the final battle
Final battle:

Note: Make sure to mention the cages of the Arena being smashed and if the players have defeated the creatures beforehand, mention explicitly that creatures would have razed the village if there were any left.

## NPC's and places
### Jaka Itzel
> A quaint, mystical village with thatched cottages and twisting cobblestone streets, lit by carved jack-o'-lanterns placed outside each home. During the festival, each villager wears handmade masks adorned with straw and bog lilies, which they believe disguise them from the dark creatures lurking beyond.
The Village Layout: Jaka Itzel is surrounded by a shallow moat and wooden fences, adorned with woven charms, dried herbs, and scarecrow figures meant to ward off spirits. Lanterns light the main village square, where festivities are underway.
Village Square: This is where most festival activities happen, such as storytelling, mask-making, and the grand pumpkin carving contest and the games.
Ruling class: an administrator from the empire, Mayor Lorna, rules the town, even she may be an external party, an envoy from the ruling government, she respects local customs and is respected by her people.
The storytelling circle is led by the Bog Keeper:
> The Bog Keeper:
> An old crotchety man wearing robes made of moss, adorned with several tattoos. A shaman that knows the magic of the Bog, that told stories need a positive ending, or a story that implies that the village is safe, as the stories tend to come true.

### The Bog
Known as the Whispering Mire, it’s a dark, mist-laden wetland covered in twisted, ancient trees with vines hanging down, and patches of phosphorescent mushrooms that glow faintly. The mire’s magic is a well-kept village secret, known only to a select few, such as the local “Bog Keeper,” a role that’s been passed down for generations.

#### The Prance of the Pumpkin Patch:Lore
1. The Night of the Masks: Villagers craft their masks from natural materials, hoping the bog spirits will be tricked into thinking they’re one of their own. Each mask represents an aspect of a folk tale — The Mireling (made of moss), The Bog Whisps (a sheet of cloth draped over one's face), The Grinning Toad (a clay frog face), and now the Pumpkin Man (A Jack O Lantern)
2. The Storytelling Circle: Elders gather by the bonfire and tell tales of the bog spirits and creatures they’ve encountered. These stories, unbeknownst to the villagers, empower the bog, which brings these nightmares into physical form in the coming days.
3. The Carnival Games: Several locals and traverlers come to town to host the amusement for the locals.
4. The Lantern Prance: The festival culminates in a “prance” where villagers light pumpkin lanterns and circle the bog’s edge. They chant a protective song that, in their minds, holds back the bog monsters for another year. These chants have true power, casting a protective barrier if the people’s belief is strong enough.
Local legends:
- The Mireling: A skeletal creature covered in swamp weeds and decayed roots. It latches onto villagers, attempting to drag them into the bog to “become one with the Mire.” Its weakness is light, especially from the lanterns made during the Prance.
- Bog Wisps: Mischievous, glowing spirits that lure villagers into the bog with promises of wishes or loved ones lost to the swamp. They thrive on deception and can transform into terrifying figures from village tales.
- The Grinning Toad: A giant, horrid toad-like beast with red eyes and a human-like grin. It speaks in riddles and can only be defeated if players answer its questions wrong, as it thrives on confidence and certainty.
- The Pumpkin Man: A ghostly figure with a jack-o’-lantern head that glows with an eerie red flame. It feeds on fear, specifically targeting those with weak belief in the festival. Players can banish it by leading it into the village’s largest pumpkin field, where the magic of the Prance is strongest.

#### The Crooked Reed Tavern
The Crooked Reed Tavern is a dimly lit, weathered building at the heart of Jaka Itzel. Made from swamp wood and heavy bog stones, it leans slightly to one side, giving it a charmingly crooked appearance. Moss creeps up the outer walls, and a painted wooden sign above the door shows a single green reed bending in the wind, its reflection rippling on imaginary water.
Walking into the Crooked Reed feels like stepping into the heart of Jaka Itzel’s history and mystery. The scent of peat smoke and bog spices fills the air, mingling with the warmth of cooking stew and the faint, earthy aroma of damp wood. A large fireplace crackles to one side, and above it hangs an ancient fishing net, tangled with charms and trinkets the villagers toss in for luck and protection.

##### Personnel
Marla Bogston — Owner and Bartender
- A sturdy woman with gray-streaked hair and a voice as rough as the Mire’s reeds. Marla is fiercely protective of the villagers and has a deep knowledge of local lore and legends, passed down from her mother and grandmother, who ran the tavern before her. She's quick with a laugh but even quicker with a scolding for anyone disrespecting the town’s traditions. Marla’s drinks have a touch of “swamp magic” to them, particularly her famed “Witch’s Wisp Ale,” said to leave you warm from the inside out, no matter the chill.

Quen Finch — Cook and Storyteller
- Quen is a lanky, soft-spoken man with sharp eyes and a memory as vast as the bog itself. He’s known for his “Bog Gumbo,” a thick stew full of spiced root vegetables, lakefish, and herbs from the Mire. While serving, he shares eerie tales between ladles, his voice carrying a spooky charm that makes the stories feel like secrets whispered only to you. Quen claims he once saw the Mireling himself and has the scars on his leg to prove it, though no one can get the same version of the story out of him twice.

Lyssa “Laughing Lil” Fenmore — Barmaid and Entertainer
- Lyssa, known as “Laughing Lil” for her loud, contagious laugh, keeps spirits high on even the dreariest nights. With her wavy auburn hair, bright red cloak, and a playful gleam in her eye, she navigates between tables with ease, dodging hands and jokes alike. She sometimes hums haunting tunes that echo the sounds of the bog. On the rare nights the bog fog rolls too close, she’ll sing the old protective chant under her breath as she works, sending chills through any listener.

## Story Circle
### Mireling
> The fire crackles and the Bog Keeper, a stooped elder with knotted fingers and a face as weathered as tree bark, settles onto a wooden stump at the center of the storytelling circle. The villagers lean in, their faces half-lit by the firelight, flickering in the shadows cast by their masks. After a moment of silence, the Bog Keeper’s voice, deep and gravelly, fills the night air.
> Now listen close, children, for this is the tale of the Mireling — one of the oldest horrors to crawl from the depths of the Whispering Mire.
> Long ago, when Jaka Itzel was nothing but a handful of huts and bog shacks, there was a farmer by the name of Rale. Rale was a stubborn, proud sort. The villagers would warn him, 'Don’t stray too far into the Mire come sundown, or the spirits will claim you.' But Rale paid no mind to the old ways. He laughed, saying there was nothing to fear in the bog that a good swing of his axe couldn’t handle.
> One fateful evening, he went out to gather moss, right as the sun dipped below the trees and cast the Mire in shadows. He was far from the village by then, lost in the winding paths and thick mist. And that’s when he heard it — the sound of something dragging through the mud. Slow, wet, sloshing sounds. At first, he thought it was an animal, maybe a boar or some other swamp beast. But then he saw it.
> A figure, hunched and skeletal, with its flesh stretched tight like wet leather over its bones, came crawling through the muck. It was covered in bog weeds, draped in decaying roots, and as it neared, Rale saw the hollow sockets where eyes should have been, dark and empty as the midnight sky. Yet somehow, it saw him. It looked right through him.
> Rale, proud and foolish, stood his ground, brandishing his axe and calling it all manner of curses. But the creature just kept coming, dragging itself closer, and as it did, Rale’s body grew heavy as if the mud itself was pulling him down. He couldn’t run. He couldn’t even breathe as the Mireling stretched out a hand made of twisted reeds and muck-stained bones.
> The next morning, Rale’s wife found his axe lying in the middle of the path, sunk deep into the mud. But Rale was nowhere to be found. No body, no tracks, just the silence of the bog. The village mourned him, yet none dared search the Whispering Mire. Everyone knew what had taken him.
> Since then, they say the Mireling wanders the edge of the bog, seeking more company to pull beneath the surface, cursed to wander alone in the wet earth for all eternity. And it remembers the scent of fear — the fear it feeds on. Those who are too curious, too bold for their own good… they hear it at night, that slow, wet sloshing sound.
> Even now, in these very woods, they say the Mireling watches. You’ll know it by the smell of rot, the faint sound of dragging footsteps, and the heavy weight in your chest that tells you to flee, though your feet feel like they’re sinking into mud. But it’s already too late by then… because it knows you. It knows the warmth of your blood, and the beat of your heart. And once it catches you, it’ll drag you down, to wander the bog for eternity, just like poor, foolish Rale.”
> The Bog Keeper’s gaze sweeps over the circle of villagers, eyes glinting with firelight, a half-smile on his weathered face. “So keep your lanterns bright, stay close to the village, and don’t stray from the Prance… because there’s only one thing the Mireling craves.”
> He leans forward, voice dropping to a whisper.
> "Company."
