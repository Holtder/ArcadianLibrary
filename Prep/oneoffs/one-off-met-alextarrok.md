### The Judgment
> The soundless void has a sense of deafening peacefulness to it. It was only moments ago that you stepped into the mists. Or was it years? It truly doesn't matter, as long as you are here. As long as you are nowhere, nowhere means peace. Order and chaos are meaningless as they describe the manner in which matters act out. There are no matters here. The infinite nothingness is familiar to you, you remember it from before you were born. Your soul didn't exist for such an infinite long time. Then you were born and forgot all about that place devoid of existence. You were fresh into the world, able to enjoy the gift of being without being burdened by the knowledge of how small it truly is. Oddly enough, upon death, upon returning to the nothingness, it all comes back to you, as your being is spread across the infinite and your soul is forfeit again. Your memories of life pale in comparison. It forms a distant star on the empty canvas that you see, that you feel, that you are.
> Nothing happens. Forever and never. 
> Until it does. The star in the distance that you once were, the pinprick of existence that you pierced through the fabric of non-reality suddenly returns to you, becomes you. The burdens of life start pulling on you once again, and while you yearn to stay in the void, unbothered, unchanged, untaken. Another part of you, the part that is, instead of isn't, grasps for existence. 
> Your sense of touch returns first; it is cold, wet even, you are submerged. You sink and float at the same time, crushed between the weight of water. Then sight returns, finally, you can finally see something again. It is pitch black darkness, but even complete darkness is so much more than nothingness. Your feel your body again. Choking. Your emotions, fear. Your movements, frantic. You take hold of something coarse and hold on for all that you stand for, pulling yourself outside of the water, but more importantly, out of the void.
> It is night. The sky is filled with stars such as you once were. A large bright blue moon shines down on the land. The rocks you hold onto.. wait, no rocks, bones. The bones you hold onto are few of thousands, lining this riverbank that edges the black water you are climbing out of. The river rushes as you let yourself collapse amongst these skeletons of old, you see it moving along until it reaches a large palace made of white marble.
> Of the skeletons around you, many differ in size, configuration and complexity. One skull in particular seems like it should be human, except for the discerning fact that it is beyond the size of an oak tree. It is from this skull that you hear a voice, soft spoken yet firm.
> "Tarrok Wolfsbrother, are you ready for judgement?"
> A man, you think he once was a dwarf, rests atop the skull. He bears a large Scythe on his back

### Meeting Thoradin Blackhammer
- Tell him that all who have no clear course in the afterlife, need to be judged.
- List moments in his life that need to be defended (look up in recap) 
- As children, you and your sister Scara scammed merchants and bandits out of their money by pretending to be hurt by their carriage, only to extort them of their money. Some might say you got more money out of that than you'd need to prevent starvation; you were even comfortable at times. Were those evil acts truly out of bare neccesity?
- As a follower of the mailman, you plotted, stole and killed in his name, without ever knowing if what he stood for was truly right. You now stand to bear the consequences of those actions. Explain to me your faith in him: 
    - Do you believe he stands for goodness, and so what you did must have been for goodness as well?
    - Do you not believe in his goodness, but his goals justify the means?
    - Did you do what you did in your own name, instead of his?
- As a freshly minted ringkeeper, you pestered the young lad Milo, who truly feared for his life several times. You even allow his father old man Dimport to send him out towards the Orcen encampment. What was your thought behind this.
- During your travels; you joined a Guild, swore feilty to them. Even if they are free spirits that don't require anything from their members, you never returned but once, and that is when you required their aid. How do you feel about that?
- Let me show you something

### The flashback
> You see your surroundings change, the bones grow over with grass as the skull Thoradin is sitting on changes into a large and luxurious merchants cart. The river coils around you two and turns into a wall made of stakes. The area changes into a war torn encampment as trees rise outside of it to great heights. You are at the Ra'adock encampment. It is eerily silent.
Tell me Tarrok, what kind of person were you in life? 
- Ask vague questions on life and the afterlife, ask him answer truly 
    - What were your allegiances in life, how does it feel to be freed of them?
    - Why is it that, even when Ra'adok died, you still continued your ways? Was it truly revenge that drove you? Or a lack of purpose?
    - If it were your friends who perished on the day you died, would you have continued their plight? 
        - After your death, your friends have not done so for you, they have not continued the search for Scara and the five pronged star. What are your feelings on that?
He dissapears 
- Puzzle: Tarrok can't leave the camp, he has to go through the door of the cart; which has a few mirrored windows
- The Gentlemen’s Door
    - A doorframe with a ‘reflection’ of the door user blocking the way. You can clearly see what is behind the door, but no matter what you do, your reflection will mimic your actions and block the way.
    - To get passed the door, you must step to the side and say “after you!” Or some other reasonably polite thing. The reflection will say “no no please I insist!” And will step to the side and motion for you to enter. Upon passing the door, your ‘reflection’ vanishes.
    - Another option is to close your eyes before opening it.

### Back at the river
I am a psychopomp, a guardion of a proper transition from life to the afterlife. Cultures have different names for me, Avatar of Death, Shinigami, Mortal Usher, gatekeeper. Little is known about where our order came from but we serve Pharasma, the god of Fate, Judgment, Birth and Death, God of the afterlife. You are standing in her domain, the Boneyard, on top of the tower of Axis.
- Offer a choice, 
    - abandon the life you once had. Take on the mantle of psychopomp but abandon his quest for his sister, his loyalty to the mailman and spend eternity as a living being responsible for the proper passing of souls. Know that your domain will change depending on your task and is subject to change.
    - Go where he was meant to go, a place reserved for followers of the mailman, he cut a deal with Pharasma

### Timeskip
> Ten years pass as you infiltrate the Abyss, you sailed the River Styx until you reached one of it's seven lands, the land of Wrath, Uligor, It was a long way to reach your destination, the City of Oph. You passed through the forsaken Ashvale, towards Urgach, the land of everlasting war until you reached the Toll Bridge, where most need to pay too great a cost to pass. You are not most people and you do not work for just someone. You were granted passage, although it was not without fight. You reached Oph, the city of hatred. It is the city of demons and represents the untypical, organization of chaotic wrath. Even a warlord needs to create a certain amount of order, and the Demon Prince of Wrath, Orcus, made sure it was maintained to soem extend in Oph. Human souls slaved over the upkeep of this city, to pay amends for their sins. You were not here for them, you were here for a specific soul, one that was never supposed to turn up here.
> You step into the Foul Cathedral, an old church building which is said to be stolen by a Tlaaxu demon two centuries ago, which now features a bar run by that demon and served by the monks that lived in it, paying for their sins of molesting innocent followers of their god.
> You are looking for a demon named F'arklor, a runt pit fiend that is said to have taken a good soul down to the abyss by offering it a dark contract. Demons don't do contracts, Devils do, the poor man is here on unjust grounds and you are here to fix it.
Let it play out, end the session with the rumor that a famous demon, Agadûl, tricked two living souls to the Abyss and they are said to arrive at the city of Amas.
