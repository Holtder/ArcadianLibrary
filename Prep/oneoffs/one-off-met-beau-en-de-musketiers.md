    - Quick summary 
        - Stories speak of a sacred sword hidden in a forsaken temple in the nearby woods. Dawnbreak. It appears as just any other blade would, but when the right incantations are said, it reveals its true power. However, Dawnbreak will only reveal itself to heroes.
        - A small lumbering village nearby to the forest was recently bought out by a larger lumbernig company. On the chieftains chair now sits a burocrat who wishes the power of the sword to himself. He is too cowardly and too afraid of the perils that might surround the blade and its holdings that he decided to get heroes to do it for him.
        - As the legend says the sword only reveals itself to heroes he sent out the word for heroes to come to a feast in his name in the town hall. There he will choose from the crowd based on their heroic accolades who he will send out to the woods. Which will be the party obviously.
        - Before being send out, the players will be informed of the first few words of the incantation that awakens the sword: "Blessed blade, reveal'. This is only part of the incantation and should make the sword glow a golden light and reveal it's insciptions, saying "The Break of Dawn" in Elven for a few seconds. If the players hold the sword while doing this they'll feel a warm breeze come over them but nothing more.
        - The final bossfight is back at the town hall.
    - What is the plottwist? 
        - The sword holds two names, depending on the wielder. Its well known name Dawnbreak is accompanied by its other name "Nightfall". It functions as a judge of character. Good people will be emboldened by its golden glows. Evil people will grow more vile as a dark, slithery aura surrounds the sword and its wielder.
        - The interim chieftain will use the full incantation as he holds the blade: "Blessed Blade, reveal to me my true nature" The sword will glow gold for a few seconds before turning black, as dark, thorny roots grow from the handle and embed themselves in the arm of the chieftain. His eyes will go dark, he will summon minions and he will be the true boss of the session.

## Introduction
Song: Road to Mournhold - ASKII
It is a soft and pleasant morning. On the tail end of winter, frozen dew still crisps the grass around you as it cracks under the weight of you cart. The sun has risen above the horizon and is slowly reminding the world of its existence. A sight which, to some of the people in this world, is still one of the most remarkable things to wake up to each and every morning, as not too long ago, there was no such guarantee. This morning light shimmers through the windows of the ten carts that are being pulled through the muddy road to the east. You take a gander outside and are met with the rolling hills of the Forest Borderlands. A free land with no Lord to rely on, but also no Lord to be restricted by. A feature most if its inhabitants are most proud of. The people here are hardy, self-reliant and keen on protecting their way of life. You've heard of these lands before. They're often described as luscious forests, ample hunting grounds and lovely townships, but in the same breath most would advice against visiting the borderlands. As the name suggests, these lands border the Lotaari forest, A confusing and twisted woodland with ever changing contents and inhabitants. As the carriage coach told you before stepping in.
> (voice; northen accent, pronounce O's as OE's, use sharp F's)
> "Aye, the forest to the north, the deep forest, is a place only few enter, and fewer leave. There is no good that may come from such cursed lands, and it's vile stink permeates to the south. Sure, the greens around here may seem harmless, but the influence of the Lotaari forest can be felt. Heard even if you care to listen. There is something ancient, primordial even to these forests and I care not to find out."
The cart softly trudges on, the horses breathe and pant along, as the morning softly passes. It is already late in the afternoon when your cart arrives in Labon.

## Playthrough and order of things
### Opening
- After the intro describe the town 
    - It's a small tribal village, surrounded with wooden poles which function as a wall. A large bonfire is kept buring at all times. People are walking around in furs and everyone seems to be working. Communal vibe
    - There's a large wooden hall which seems to be the main dining hall, it's closed for now.
- Explain that the first carriage of the day arrives in town.

### Exploration
- First carriage contains Alex's character. Let him explore for a bit. Once he arrives at the tavern have Tijn's character sit there already and have him describe himself.

#### Tavern: the Grappled Goblin
The inn is a simple wooden shack, with a poorly-thatched roof and a large cellar. Accomodations consist of a few small rooms with straw mats. The innkeeper is an old male halfling named Wisym Eyder, he has curly gray hair just about everywhere on his body beside his head. He blames the gods for every misfortune. The rooms for rent at The Grappled Goblin are surprisingly average sized and notably hygenic. There are currently three rooms available for rent with all the commotion coming into town. The cost for a night's stay is 1 sp, 1 cp. If the party spends the night in the tavern, strange whispers and soft chanting disturbs their sleep throughout the night. 
The hall of the tavern is noticably busy due to the travelers, but a lot of locals seem to be eating here.

##### Menu:
- Drink: House Hard Cider; 3.32% ABV; A house-brewed light amber cider. Described as a sour cider with a creamy finish. Pint price: 1 cp
- Food Menu
    - Starter: Bread Bowl; A bowl of stale whole wheat bread. Served with olive oil for dipping. 3 cp
    - Soups and Salads
        - Scallop Soup; A thin soup with scallops and cubed potatoes. 6 cp
        - Iceberg Salad; Leaves of iceberg tossed with cucumbers. 6 cp
    - Entree: Pan-fried Beef; Pan-fried strips of beef served over mashed potatoes. 1 sp, 4 cp The meat in this dish is overcooked to the point of being nearly inedible.

#### Dining hall
Music: Viking Dining Hall - Plate Mail Games
> As you enter the town hall you are presented with a rather confusing sight. You can see the idea the builder had in mind while making of this dining hall, long tables and long benches which seem to be well used. The walls are made of wood from the trees in the surrounding area. Several animal pelts are used for cushioning the benches. It all seems very functional, what you might expect from a small tribal village in the borderlands. However, in addition to this sight you see very elaborate diningware, silver cutlery, adorned plates and the walls feature several tapestries depicting saws, trees and logs of wood. A lot of form over function if you will. At the end of the hall there is one table perpendicular to the rest, at the middle of the table sits a man who catches your eye. Shoulder length brown curly hair, he is wearing pompously decorated leather clothing with a rather big wolves pelt, including head, over his left shoulder. If anyone in this room is the chieftain, it would be him. Around his neck hangs a pendant in the shape of a circular saw. Beside him stands a short, thick man with greasy, combed over hair, who does not seem to leave his master's side.
Let the players take a seat, allow them to converse a bit.
- Opening speech by Chieftain Cromwell 
    - Welcome
    - All of them are invited because of their heroic deeds, well known or otherwise.
    - A selection of them shall be invited to find a lost artifact in the nearby woods.
Have NPC's speak of their heroics once in a while:
- A female half elf named Hilda covered in burn scars, especially around her face, will proudly say that she's an archaeologist who went into the hidden temple of Deepstone in the kingdom of Tiressea, and saved a party of three from the evils that they had unleashed upon the world.
- A male human named Hakim tells of the fight of the Ringkeep, where he fought of an onslaught of ghouls and even withstood the burning presence of a Demon Lord.
- A male, fiery red Kitsune speaks up, he assisted three heroes during the battle of Felbrook, where they fought of a coven of Hags who were attacking the elven port town during a cursed eclipse.
Have the players tell their story, maybe roll diplomacy. In the end they will be chosen and asked to return the morning after.

### Setting off
The players will meet the next morning with Lord Cromwell, who will tell them of the journey ahead:

## Town
### Rumors
Knowledge local checks:
- 10: 
    - All these visitors are a hassle, the place doesn't seem to be well built for such an event. Occupying the dining hall means the locals do not eat.
- 15: 
    - The local milling company has been helpful in maintaining the town but the boss of the company has taken residence in the chieftains hall and has been referring to himself since
- 20: 
    - The old chieftain just decided to leave one day. He bid his farewells and that was it, that was two years ago.
