# Background Meow N'one
Although not more than a tiny dot on the map, the village of Baltica proves to be more influential than most nearby cities. Providing new insights in technology, politics and especially complex water systems meant for farming en energy production. Some owe it to the favorable location of the village, others believe a more transient cause.   
In the small village of Baltica lives a very loving Gnome family. Although always willing to help their neighbours in whatever way they could. In essence, the family Hamuur is a simple farming family, where non of the members are registered with a company. However they are believed to play essential parts in the village's evolution. The immense variation of the family being there main power. The gnome family consists of 9 members.   
The father, Nubrata, earns the money for the family by growing produce and selling it in nearby cities. Determination has always been his strongest characteristic and his tongue spit silver, especially after some goldstrike, his favorite special.   
The mother, Nelive, was a kind and social person, especially for a gnome. Always maintaining close relationships with village members. She knows exactly what happens in Baltica and beyond, far beyond.  
The oldest sibling, Marash (16) Always was a real pain in the ass. Although his heart beats in the right place, he is always looking for an excuse to get in trouble. Although his colourfull grafitti creations can be marked as artistic, most village members can't appreciate it that much.   
The younger daughter Leysha (15), was by far the smartest of the family and probably of the whole village. She created multiple machines for farming, housing medical purposes and occasionally the pranks for her brother. Furthermore, some family members believe she is able to foresee the nearby future due to her amazing streaks in rock-paper-scissor.   
Her twin sister, Sháley (15), was more of a bigmouth. Although not the wisest, there was few that she couldn’t manage to get from people. She always knows exactly what someone is thinking and how she can use this in her advantage. Furthermore, she is the only real competition for Leysha in rock-paper-scissor contests.   
The younger sister, Iley, of 12 years was more of the silent type. Although, she likes to be near people, real interaction is hard to get from her. She spends more time talking to the gods than anyone else.   
The youngest brothers Genza is only 1 year old. His character is still unknown although his eyes of mixed leavegreen and firered predict great plans for this gnome in diapers.   
The last member of the family was the housedog ‘Woof’. His white fur and speed made him occasionaly look like a heron. People knew not to attack this guard dog’s house, or else.   
  
From day to day live, the family members where much involved in all inhabitants of Baltica. with the exception of the day Woof went missing. On a strange stormy day, the dog was nowhere to be seen. Immidiately the family searched in parties, strangely with no success. In the subsequent days the weather got worse and so did the hopes of the family for the return of woof. Then, on day six, Woof returned, as did the normal spring weather. Woof arrived back home with in his mouth a baby of approximately 1 year of age. Although he shared some characteristics with gnomes. His ears immediately showed he was a halfling. His white tainted silver hair was bigger than his body and his eyes were evenly mixed with sapphire blue and thundering yellow. The family was shocked, surprised, relieved, and evenly scared. Nubrata being the first to react when Woof arrived thundered this event was a gift from the gods and cheerfully celebrated the new member of the family, going by the name of Mohik Saria loosely translated as gift of the forest.   
Mohik was nurtured just as the rest of the family. Equally hars from nubrata, kind from Nelive and surprisingly much from Iley, who spoke even more with Mohik than her gods. During his growing up, Mohik seemed little different from everybody else, except for his characteristics as a halfling ofcourse. Although he was halfling, he generally had much in common with the gnomes. His lack of thinking before taking action and fondness for nature exceeds even some typical gnomes. However his oppurtunism and playful humor gives away his (un)natural roots. One day Nubrata and Nelive took Mohik apart when he was 14 years of age to tell him the story of his arrival. Mohik appeared shocked and his presence gave an odd appearance. With some doubt, his parent told him something else; the amulet. When he arrived, there was a blue pendant around his neck. His parents took it away, scared that he would choke on the chain and hid it in their special part of the farming ground. When Mohik received the pendant, a different kind of energy floated through him and the pendant turned yellow. He felt different. Although in the subsequent years he seemingly acted no differently.   
Although he acted no differently, in his mind he grew tired of the village, his corporations and buildings. At young age he joined his fathers trading days to nearby cities. In essence to flee his own village, however helping was his second nature which he loved to do. On this trips he slowly made money. Not with selling produce, this money was meant for the family. He earned money with pickpocketing disrescpectfull persons. People who had no respect for nature and smaller beings. When he was 17 it was time to leave the village. He didn’t left to nearby cities, instead he went deep into the nature. At first he felt great, energised by his surrounding and freedom. However, he found out that he couldn’t provide for himself in the nature. Not being a skilled hunter and his deep resentment of killing proved an unsuitable combination with living outside the cities. After 2 years pinballing from nature with little food to cities where he felt unhappy, he decided to come return to Baltica, to his family.   
In 3 days he arrived in the city, welcomed by a strange sight. The Streets where empty and in all directions damaged houses were connected with each other by a trail of water. Zig-zagging via all the houses the trail ended at his old home. Arriving there with painfull shocks on his chests he saw bones piled up in the center of the room. Everything wet from the ground to the ceiling. Slowly his visioned darkened as he believed to faint. At this moment the pendant started moving on his own, pumping inside him a burning sensation of a magnitude unknown to him. Exploding of emotions he searched for someone who could answer his questions. He was informed that the attack happened during the night merely 3 days ago. Nobody still alive heard anything, but during sunup it was clear that 88% of the village people, including his family, were murdered. The strange exception with the house of the family Hammuur, were the bones and unusual water. The rest of the people where seemingly plainly murdered with probably some kind of sharp sword. However the bones, or the lack of bodies, were only present in the house of his family. Mohik couldn’t stand it anymore and needed to run, run as far as possible. (unconsciously in the direction to the fey forrest?) After 5 days solely running, he couldn’t take more than one step. He fell down on his back. Not knowing if he just imagined the sky or really managed to open his eyes he started asking quastions to his (gnome god). Is this my fault? Is my whole family dead? Who am I anyway? What was that feeling from my pendant? And what do I have to do? At this moment he realised there was only one thing he needed to do. search for the people responsible for his grief. He decided to a new name, meow. For he no longer trusted others anymore. With his growing determination, the pendant started radiating a blue light and lending him the strength to stand up and walk to the nearest city.   
Hungry and thirsty he entered the first city he saw. Because he had no money to buy food or drinks, he tried to pickpocket. In the distance he saw an half orc, anxiously looking in the crowd. Slowly and stealthily he approached the half-orc. Seemingly in deep concentration for an orc, MeaWith a swift sleight of hand he managed to grab his full sacket of GP. However during the escape, he heard an elf behind him in the middle of the crowd yell “Tarok, Tarok, behind you”. On which the half Ork turned around and quickly out passed Mohik’s small and exhausted legs. Although the two were not happy for the attempt to steal there stolen money, they admired the bravery and pickpocketing skills of this small fellow and decided to treat the exhausted halfling on a meal. During the meal Mohik realised this may be the answer to his questions. Although it felt strange, he strongly believed that right now, this party was his purpose. Leaving his newly acquired distrust behind he joined the party. Strongly believing this is the way to find his enemies. Whoever they may be. Wherever they will go, this will lead him to his answers.

During the travels Meow discovers his own powers. He gains more and more convidence in his friends who lead him to every corner of the earth. Meow is amazed by the landscapes and adventures they make. In the adventures Meow and his friends come te realise that big events will hapen in the world, with them right in the middle of it. The stories continue and Meow finds out more and more about his past and even destiny. He was grown in Baltica where the terible massacre of a big part of the city and his whole family occured. Meow learns that the peace of the dead is disturbed in the moores near Baltica. The cause is a war between the p'themora, a tribe of gnomes and Druma, tribe of halflings before darkfall. before darkfall a treaty was made, peace was restored. However, always 2 watchers, 1 from both tribes should be present to watch the Moores. when Mohic, watcher of the druma left his hometown, the pact was disturbed and Mohic lost his destiny as the Druma. To find out more of the moors, the group heads out into it. Tarok died because of a tainted Woof in a gruweling way. Tarok joined them as a ghost. Shocked by this the group reached further for a way to restore the life of their friend. They eventually found the water spirit who wanted to restore the destiny of the druma in Meow, however he had to let go of his friend Tarok. Tarok commanded him to accept the offer and so Meow did.

I am responsibel for the gate. something obstructs. something is causing pain.   
there are 2 spirits bound to the gate. A creature forms. I see claws, rubbery skin. I see a head. a frog like creature. This creature bound by the contract is responsibel for what happened two years ago. it is hiding in the moors. Afraid to what is due to the spirits of the moors. The wat er form, a woolf like creature forms, it stares at me. a haedrodemon. The devils make deals and contracts. Usually for worse.
