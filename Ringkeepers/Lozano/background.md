# Background Lozano Vicerion
Lozano grew up in a peaceful town called Chucky Town. His youth was fairly uncomplicated,  
the town was quiet and everybody knew each other well. His parents had a good job as  
merchants and he never lacked anything. But Lozano never felt at ease, from the moment he  
started reading about traveling and adventurers at the age of 6, he wanted to roam the  
world and start his own adventure. But with his parents being so protective and the strict  
religious community he lived in this proved a tough objective. His younger years were filled  
with peace and boredom. They only thing that gave him some excitement was training his  
little pet rabbit, in his fantasy this was a dragon animal companion. Until the day he would  
later call ‘The Day of Fire and Magic’ happened. Lozano, now 14 years old, was leaning  
against the old willow tree at the edge of the town when the sky suddenly turned black. A  
big implosion followed and the whole city was gone in less than a second. The strange thing  
was, the city was not destroyed but just disappeared in no time. Lozano ran to the place  
where his parents’ house once stood and found nothing. No house, no parents, no pet,  
nothing. Lozano became desperate at the thought he would never see his parents again and  
started panicking. He ran to several spots in the town until he finally reached the town  
square. The fountain in the middle of the square was gone, just like almost everything else,  
only a small wooden cabinet stood on the empty square. Lozano recognized it immediately  
as the longbow-cabinet of his father. In this cabinet his father stored his most valuable  
belonging: “Lysanthir”. The best bow ever made in history, his father told stories that it  
contained deep magic and has the power to save the world. But now it was gone, at the spot  
where the bow once was stored now appeared only a devilish looking logo. Feeling not at  
ease he ran away from the location of his hometown and started his own adventure. He  
broke with his parent’s God and found solace in the guidance of Ketephys.  
He started to become a hero in survival in the woods and a master in bowmanship and  
decided to invest in these skills to reach the following 3 goals:  
1\) Investigate the mystery of the The Day of Fire and Magic and understand what  
happened to his parents and Lysanthir  
2\) Find and kill everything that has ties to a Devilish nature  
3\) Follow his childhood dream and learn to tame animals with as main goal to find a  
badass creature as animal companion (maybe the Owlbear)
