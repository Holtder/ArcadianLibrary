# Session notes

## Session 050:
The heroes find themselves in a new room with three swinging giant axes. Meow immediately flies into one luring 2 undead creatures towards Thaddeus. When they kill the first creature it turns into a magnetic pile changing the course of the swinging axes. There are also 2 statues at the end of the hall which then burst open and 4 more of the same undead creatures jump out. Lozano uses positive energy channeling to wipe out the rest of them. After this they find a lever in one of the exploded statues, it might open the 2 big iron doors at the end of the room, however they don't trust is. Instead the decide to swing one of the giant axes toward the door. This breaks the door mechanisme and bursts open the door. They enter the next room which is huge, the room is filled with square pillars with words on it. At the end of the room is a dead body that still has seizures, a headless ghost floats around slowly. The pillars together form a tragedy about wizards, they sought out immortality. The wizards were deeply in love with each other, one day they found a dark ritual which could only be done once every 1000 years. The wife performed it on her husband making him immortal and then she went into 1000 years of sleep. In this 1000 years the body of the man was immortal but his mind lingered down. After a 1000 years of sleep the woman wakes up finding her husband alive but not reacting. However he had already finished the ritual she she too will lose her mind in time. After reading the words on the pillars the words start glowing and a cabinet door opens. In the cabinet the heroes find a head, the head is cursed and belongs to the decapitated body they found in the same room. It claims to be the architect of the whole dungeon and agrees to help the heroes to destroy the defilers that entered his domain. The deal they struck would reward him to be united again with his body. The Architect tells Hogar (the demon lord of wrath who bound his soul to Groomsh and who stole his powers and locked them with 4 defensive seals) defiled this place. The Architect tells that the 4 defensive seals are locked in the city of Axis, it lies in another plane. From this room they can go East (the Troth, the copper priest) or South (the laboratory, the room of graves). In between the two lies the changing pits. The heroes decide to attach the head to its decapitated body again. The ghost enters the body and the heroes hear: fare thee well Ringkeepers in your fight against Umbra and remember the story of the wizards and the curse of loneliness.

## Session 051:
The heroes decide to head to the Troth, Thaddeus goes first and enters a room with a turntable to grab a torch. At that moment he hears 12 undead creatures behind him. They make a plan in which they lure the enemies with light towards a trap which then explodes. Afterwards Lozano uses positive energy which wipes out almost al of them. Meow finishes it of in style with a gusting blast. They find the turning table to be locked so they can't open the door adjacent to it. Meow turns into gasseous form and infiltrates te room behind where he finds a statue of a copper pries with two candles. In front of it there is a pond with floating eyes like the found before in the well. He breaks gasseous form and opens the door from the inside. The moment he does this all the eyes starts moving up forming a large creature of mouths and eyes. It sends out a noise that confuses Aloy, Lozano and Meow causing them to attack each other. At one moment the creature eats Thaddeus whole and he kills it from te inside causing al the eyes to pop and explode. The creature is killed and the heroes now stand in the Troth in front of the Copper Priest statue. Meow lights both candles, and nothing happens. Then Thaddeus finds out that the candle fits inside a socket and the statue moves back and opens a pit with a ladder in it. The heroes descend into a storage area where the find a Staff of Healing, a transmutational ring of necromancy and a book with as title: ULIGOR. They head into the next hallway and enter pitchblack darkness. Lozano finds out it is caused by a darkness spell which comes from a lantern hanging from the ceiling. The heroes steal the lantern and put it in the bag of holding. Afterwards they head towards the pit where a lot of undead creatures are torturing humanoids into becoming undead. They strike and kill the enemies and at the mean time they "saved" the people by healing them out of existence. In a imbecile move Lozano decides to head in to the pit which leads to him automatically being grappled by a horde of undead people. He tries to crawl out without succes, Thaddeus jumps in as a tiger and grapples the pile of undead dealing blistering damage again and again. The heroes fire everything they have, Lozano would have been dead two times if it wasn't for life pact. In they end they barely scrape through. After a good night's rest the heroes make way towards the Laboratory, in this room they find a stone altar, bisected skulls, several empty vials. Next to that they find a not describing a formula on how to modify an already existing potion to make sure it can control intelligent demons. They make sure to grab the notes and the potion next to it which is still brewing. Then they make way to the Room of Graves, a room filled with 8 skeletons stuck to their position behind bars. There seems to be not much of interest and head down te stairs to level 2.

## Session 052: Defender loses, you killed a baby
They walk down the stairs and enter a small room with a big metal door a looking hole with metal bars in front of it, the room is well lit however there is no source of light. When Lozano picks out the lantern of Darkness it gives of light. Trough the looking hole they see a room with a pit in the middle, green fog comes out of it. At the end of the room there is an altar with Umbra in front of it. She wears a cloth with something wrapped inside, it looks like it is moving. Agaduhl is nowhere to be seen. Hanging from chains in the ceiling is an unconscious but still living Lady Fightmount, behind her a floating skull is in the air. The heroes want to go back and make a plan when they see Lady Fightmount being lowered into the pit. At this moment the heroes try to move trough the door, Lozano uses Stone Shape but uses too much force so achieves the opposite effect. In this room there seems to be a spell which makes everything work the opposite way. Meow uses a slight breeze of wind and the door BLASTS open. When they enter Umbra shoots fireballs to them which quickly turn in to pitchblack dark balls of ice. Umbra give a speech about wanting to ...... , at the end she says that it is time to finish the job and kill the rest of the Ringkeepers.

Thaddeus bites the neck of Umbra en with his claws rips open her body to gain acces to the baby through her opened chest, at this moment he extends his claw and pushes it through the baby's face breaking Umbra's spine and killing them both in action. Both Umbra and the baby dissapear. Somewhere in this world a baby is born silently, it does not cry. Thaddeus then feeds Lozano the rabbit but nothing happens, he looks revitalized but still is a baby rabbit. When Lozano uses detect magic on the skull he feels nothingness, darkness, sadness and depression all bound together by necromancy. This creature is a demi-lych (some kind of horcrucx). Umbra screamed not again, not like someone dying but just like here we go again, this is a setback. All Lozano his magical belongings are gone.

## Session 053: We have to get the rabbit stoned! But first let met change to human form while up in the air.
Lady Fightmount is weak but alive, she is still held in cold metal chains, Taddeus decides to destroy the chains while still in his tiger form. Afterwards he heads to the book that is still on the altar, the text is written with blood and the cover is made from human skin from someones face. Taddeus takes the book and puts Lozano in its satchel, then Lady Fightmount telports them towards outside the Ulflog. The heroes tell her what deal they made for the information of Lady Fightmount's whereabouts. They will have to organize a birthday party for him later and the "promised him to be good hosts". Lady Fightmount tells them that it is never a good thing to owe something to someone who is immortal. The 4 return to town where they see the cart in which they came and immediately see Captain Wilhelm who is shocked by the state Lady Fightmount is in. They enter the cart and Wilhelm takes Lozano and drops the rabbit inside a big cooking pot which he claims to be an anti-magic pot but fails to turn him into his human form again. Lady Fightmount says Umbra was cursed herself, one of her main goals was to free herself from that curse. She explains about a Lych (this is a form of a horcrux where the mind/soul of someone is transfered to an item like a vase to achieve immortality. This Lych takes the form of a crystal skull like the one the heroes saw in the cavern with Umbra. The heroes freed it by killing Umbra and therefore the Lych turned invisible and disappears. The heroes become scared by the thought that Agaduhl now might have the full power of Groomsh and Hogar without the controlling power that Umbra was. Captain Wilhelm says he will need to dive into the books in Arcadia to puzzle everything together and also find a cure for rabbit Lozano which is really old magic. The magic they feel is that the essence of Lozano's being is transformed to a rabbit, and if they will not change Lozano quick enough the mind will also become that of a rabbit. For this they might have only days to weeks. Taddeus recalls that a herb exists that broadens the minds which might be able to enhance the connection to the God of a cleric. Strenghtening the bond to Kethephys might be able to reverse the rabbit curse. Their best chance would be to go the the clerics in Fellbrook, they might be able to help them. But first Meow and Lozano had to Hirm Graham to return the ring and try to get out of the party-deal in return. This fails since Graham pretends to not know the ring and the heroes decide to play bluff and walk away. In the meantime Taddeus made a cape for Lozano, now he is a rabbit with a cape. The heroes ask Wilhelm if he has a way of communication towards Fellbrook, he walks towards a tree and conveys a message through the roots to send a message to the clerics that the heroes are coming and they need their help. The cart including the heroes, Wilhelm, Tash and Argantus made their way towards Fellbrook. During the drive they all agree that their main goal after lifting the curse will still be to find out more about the means and goal of Ouroboros. During their ride Taddeus takes his falcon form because he wants to contemplate about the horrible murder he committed in the dungeon, at that moment he sees they are being followed by multiple crows. They are spies from Hirm Graham, they hear the voice of Graham explaining that he wants to keep an eye on the heroes because they are his investment. They ride into Fellbrook and see familiar faces like Toshio the kitsune. They head to the Hierophant hut, they tell the whole story and the Hierophant can name the herb, it is called: Prayer's Acumen. They have the herb in their stores and will start preparing, this will cost a day. The heroes head to the Willow Whisp Inn where they stayed before. Inside they meet up with Lura, the red headed old flame of Tarrok. The heroes remember her talks of going on an adventure but probably she never left Fellbrook. The heroes get way too drunk, in which Taddeus starts drunk flying and afterwards deciding to change to human form while being 3 meters up in the air, fortunately Meow saves him. The next morning they make their way out and many people are busy around the great stone slab with inscriptions where the heroes fought the hags. The plan is to try to force a connection between Lozano and his God. This will have to be done somewhere between the planes. When it fails Taddeus and Meow will be there to protect Lozano. The heroes take place on the stone slab, then Lozano takes a sip of the prepared herb. After drinking Lozano feels lighter and lighter getting the feeling to tumble forward, everything is green for a moment, then Meow and Taddeus see Lozano in human form again however wearing rabbit ears and a white tail. At this moment a giant roc as tall as a building stomps towards them, it is Aloy in gigantic form. She has baskets next to here neck, the heroes get in en she flies off with the heroes. They land close to the Free Cities in a large brown crater, which spans kilometers wide. Inside the middel of the crater there is a small wooden box with golden inscription: it spells "Chucky Town, Lozano". Lozano is shocked reading it and tells his teammates about his background, that the town that once stood there is now gone, and the last time anything stood here it was a wooden cabinet in which his father's bow once was kept: Lysanthir. Then the worlds turns black and white and red blood pours down from the heaven and they hear the voice of Agaduhl talking to them: "There is so much to be done..."

## Session 054: 12 versus HP
The heroes stand in a crater and hear a rumbling sound beneath them, tangles come up from under their feet entangling Aloy. A rumbling sound appears and two monsters appear: a tree-like one and a mushroom-mutant one. Both the monsters start attacking and hurt Meow and Thaddeus. After this Lozano uses versatile channeling to channel negative energy for the first time, also he initiates life pact. Meow flies towards Aloy who is entangled by al the branches and wants to free her but can't find a dagger. The mushroom-mutant uses a form of self -healing restoring some health after which he vomits out 2 giant toads. Thaddeus does a shit load of damage to the tree but also this monster uses some self-healing. Aloy frees herself after which Meow uses a big magnetic thunderblast. The fight rages on and Lozano is grapples by one of the poisonous toads. He escapes by the blinking dagger, in the mean time Meow identifies the mushroom-mutant as a Tendriculos, a not so intelligent creature that uses foul means of magic and it's inside being a giant bag of holding. The tree monster is identified by Thaddeus as a Quickwood, which is a monster with huge range and strong magical powers. Thaddeus tries to negotiate with the Quickwood but does not agree to lay down his weapons. The Quickwood attacks him in response. In the mean time the Tendriculous tries to swallow Meow whole, which would always succeed but the DM rolls a critical one. At that moment a giant mosquito appears that stings Lozano giving him Malaria and makes him bleed. Meow uses a cylcone attack which he never used before in which he kills one of the toads. Lozano is again grapples by the other toad but get's saved by Thaddeus using a stunning fist killing the toad. Lozano is almost killed by the Quickwood triggering the Life Pact draining the party. Thaddeus puts away his weapons and Lozano follows ending the fight for now. They now enter parlay and the ## Session is ended.

## Session 056: Too distracted to pronounce festivities or regurlary
The heroes all did their shopping however Meow got distracted by the festivities and got nothing. In the meantime Aloy has grown to large size, Lozano thinks it might be because the link with his past has grown stronger. Argantus thinks it might be because her link with Umbra might have grown stronger. Argantus sent a scout in advance, captain Hakim, to the city of Nebebat: "The Jewel of the West". It is the only city that works with Arcadia, they have a trading contract. The heroes and Aloy head to the airship and fly upwards and make way towards the Eternal Amberlands. Thaddeus and Lozano head towards the front of the ship and have a conversation. Thaddeus asks Lozano about lying about not knowing the map that Argantus showed him. Lozano tells him that his mind is conflicted, he could read the map but not graps why and how he would know about it, because in his mind he is not that old. Lozano promises Thaddeus that he will tell Meow too. In the meantime Meow decides to test out the ship's capabilities and flies it as fast as possible, this results in extreme nausea with Thaddheus but he and Lozano hold on. After a full night of flying they land at the end of the forest close to Plaveia, the plan is that they tack a short night of sleep aided by nap stack, Thaddeus goes hunting, Lozano stays behind to guard the ship with Aloy and Meow heads into the city to stock up on rations and a compass.

## Session 057: The shopping list almost kills Meow kills the whole party (TPK)
Lozano learns Aloy a new trick, she can now intercept him falling from height to save his live. In the meantime Thaddeus goes into tigerform and hunts voor food in the forest. In the mean time Meow, with the bag of holding and shopping list in hand goes to Plaveia to get rations and a compass. Due to a long queue entering the city takes too much time he uses gaseous form to fly over the walls undetected. However he lands into a dark alley where he meets 2 rogues who almost kill him after he mentions the Children of Desna. After total panic he makes the right decision to turn into gaseous form again and fly upwards to flee. The heroes are now stocked up and decide to take a flying route directly south-east of their current location. When they fly into the Eternal Emberlands they see a large delta with thousands of houses and 4 huge mansions, those mansions all have a pillar with a predator bird on top. In the beaks of those birds there are many mirrors which reflect the light coming form wooden piles which are lit. This way there is a permanent light source which lights up Nebebat during the night. When they get close to the city Meow decides to dock on top of an appartement building however Thaddeus interferes in time. When they land in the harbor a guard wearing a pin with a golden sword and shield approaches them, Adnan of the house of Ashraf. The heroes pretend to be artists to enter the city, Lozano tells his full name and the guard flinches for a moment. He explains that the family of Ashraf is one of the 4 remaining families that survived Darkfall and saved Nebebat. Thaddeus is not at ease seeing that the dock workers are not fed and treated properly. The heroes head into the city center and make way to the Inn that Adnan tipped them, it should have elephant stables in which Aloy can take a rest. In the streets Lozano gets robbed by a half-elf and the whole crew chases her. When they catch up to her they find out she is called Kresis and belongs to the Ashraf family. They head to the inn called the Bloody Trunk. The heroes see two more sigils; A radiant sunrise (Ossa family) and an orb (Ishara family). They get a room and shelter for Aloy and head into the city. They get to a square where a general with a flaming sword leads 6 slaves to the gallows, one of them being Hakim. Thaddeus who already felt fed up by the slavery in the town enrages seeing this and charges forward in tiger-form. Lozano grabs his bow and shoots the rope that connects Hakim to the gallows and breaks it, freeing Hakim. The general called Zara blinds Thaddeus, who is affected in sight but not in scent so he can still attack her. A tremendous fight starts in which Meow does tons of damage, Thaddeus grapples and directs enemies to different spots, Lozano binds everyone in Life Pact including the slaves. Guards arrive and Zara summons a Glass Golem who almost kills Thaddeus with his fist blows. The creature is strong but stupid and with 1 step he ends the live of his master. But he was summoned with one reason only, to annihilate Thaddeus. He is one step away of killing him, Lozano tries the last thing he can think of to stop the Golem. He builds a stone wall between Thaddeus and the Golem trying to topple the giant but fails. At this moment Meow takes a desperate move trying to end the fight, he throws an exploding crystal at the Golem which hits him hard causing the Glass Golem to explode in a thousand pieces piercing all the heroes, Hakim and the remaining slaves critically. All being bound to life pact they drain HP form each other however the total amount of damage is far too much for them and the whole party dies. The heroes however are able to open their eyes, they hear the voice of Agaduhl laughing "finally you're mine now". They have entered the Abyss...

## Session 058: A city a second chances, where red whine is as valuable as someone's life
Meow and Lozano wake up in dark cells, barred, they both feel a burning sensation. The place where their Children of Desna tattoo once was is now gone. In return they both have a black forked tattoo on their hands which Lozano recognizes as the logo of Agaduhl. There are 4 other cells, all empty, also there is a white light peaking in each individual cells like it is patrolling. Meow calls out to check if someone is there, Deputy Gordon responds. He tells the heroes that they are in the abyss, which is normal for slaves that tried to flee. They will be here until they are picked up by their master which is Agaduhl. They are in Oph, close to the capital Uligor in the Realm of Wrath, once the realm of Groomsh, now currently ruled by Orcus (who stole the plane from Groomsh). A moment later the heroes are magically forced to leave their cell and walk up the stairs and to enter a room where their attorney Bane stands. A tall hooded figure with tusks. He tells the heroes that he is freeing them, his intention behind this will remain unknown for now. He threatens captain Gordon, intimidates him with bringing Blackhammer to this realm which clearly shocks him. Bane barges into the next room while holding Meow and Lozano at their scruffs. In the next room there are multiple creatures (an Incubus, a Kalauakus, an inductee), all wearing police outfits. The captain begins a conversation with Bane, warning him that this action will be his downfall. Bane continues with his plan and the captain let's them go. Stepping outside rain is pouring and every drop gives a sense of hopelessness, rain in the abyss is evaporated water from the river Styx. Bane proves to be Tarrok, only much older, having a long gray beard. The side of his skull shaved bold and wearing black plate armor. He orders Meow to hump on Lozano his back and puts the grey coat around them. They make way to the Foul Cathedral, Tarrok his safe space. The place feels wrong, any town in the Abyss should not have any structure to it, however this city tries to enforce just that. The city of Oph looks like 1920's New York. They enter the Foul Cathedral, an old roman church, which seems to be a bar. All sorts of creatures are waiting tables. Behind the bar is a skinny man wearing a bowtie, his entire skin is bloody red, he is called Tlaaxu. Tlaaxu says that he sent Tarrok the letter that his old pals were in prison. To make even for this information he asks Tarrok to intercept a shipment carrying two big kegs of human wine which was taken by police as contraband. They have to be there in 5 hours, 2 blocks from here. They accept the deal and enter Tarrok his room, it is small and simple, in the corner is a detective board. There is a huge stained glass window and by peeking through it they see the river Styx flowing, a mountain range behind it, and in the middle of town a huge castle, the castle of Orcus. Tarrok tells the story of what happened to him after he died, he was floating in nothingness when he got pulled out by the Blackhammer, one of the heroes of time who was working for the Goddess of Death, Pharasma. There is a prophecy in Oph that Agaduhl is trying to gain enough power to overthrow the rule of Orcus. He probably thought that gaining the power of Agathor was enough but he did not show his face in the plane in the past decade. Tarrok is some kind of detective, ordered by Pharasma and Blackhammer. He get's cases of lost souls who have been directed to the wrong plane after death. To do this he pierces the heart of his target with his scyte turning their soul into a ring in his scythe which he then gives back to the Goddess to reallocate. The heroes start preparing for the keg retrieval.

## Session 059:
The 2 kegs of wine are kept in a police depot close to the harbor, the heroes disguise themselves and make plans. Lozano goes into meditation to switch some spells and Meow cuts down one of the curtains to make a nice outfit for himself but fails miserably. Meow and Tarrok decide to use the meditation time to scout ahead and walk past the police depot where they see that a closed down antique shop is directly on the other side of the street. Meow decides to use gaseous form to enter the police depot to look for the contraband they are looking for. At the moment he wants to cast the spell a low ranked police officer walks outside. He still casts the spell and feels a burning sensation around his ankle and turns back into his original form. They head back to pick up Lozano in the Foul Cathedral and make way to the police department. Lozano and Tarrok decide to use a command spell to halt the driver and the cop outside. Lozano fails and only the cop outside is halted by Tarrok. This results in the driver knowing something is off and uses the horn to alarm his companions. Meow uses the chaos to try and pickpocket the key ring from the halted guard but fails. Tarrok jumps in and changes into large size, slams through the glass window of the truck, grabbing the driver. He intimidates the fuck out of him and his companion ordering him to drive. The driver hits the gas pedal full on, driving over Tarrok his toes and hitting Lozano in the process. The truck now being away from the cargo hold reveals the inside of the police department and the female demon inside. This demon gets a direct look at Tarrok his face. The moment the battle is about to light up Meow decides to try the diplomatic approach. He bluffs that he will blow up the whole depot if the demon does not allow the heroes to leave. Due to his offer and the intimidating appearance of Tarrok the demon binds in and allows the heroes to leave with 2 kegs of wine and a satchel full of soul stones. Tarrok finds out that the heroes hurting her men caused her to yield. Tarrok screams loudly that they were sent by F'arklor a pitfiend runt which is Tarrok his enemy. They drive off, drop the kegs into the cellar of the Foul Cathedral. Tlaaxu is amazed by the yield and tells Tarrok his debt is payed and he will contact his friend who could relieve the heroes from their chains. The plan arrives to drive the truck into F'arklor his neighborhood to drop the truck over there strengthening the story that this raid was planned by him.

## Session 060:
The heroes are speeding over the roads on their way to the neighborhood of F'arklor while they are being chased by two hot rods which are gaining fast. Tarrok grabs Meow by the scruff and places him outside of the window next to the car and he intends to touch the asphalt to cast a explosive rune on the road. It hits one of the cars causing a electric blast causing the fuel tank to explode. The other car is now angry and pops off the hoods of the wheels. Two giant pins come out of the side of the wheels and the hot rod driver steers into the car driven by Tarrok. The other car gets disabled by Tarrok his scythe. However, the 2 demons inside the car survive. Tarrok decides to drive backwards and hits the first. But his driving skills are not great to the car tumbles and Meow gets shot like a trebuchet from the hands of Tarrok. He flies over the other demon and casts a tornado blast which surges the flames towards the demon. Tarrok uses his transformation to big size to halt the car from spinning and both him and Lozano survive. When they look ahead they see a trail of blood and flame heading into an alley. They sprint towards the alley and only see ptichblack darkness. Tarrok feels the incomprihensible urge to flee and starts running away from the alley. Lozano however defies this feeling and stares into the alley:

*As you look you immediately get the sensation you're seeing something you absolutely should not see. The face of a divinity you do not worship. The smile of a devil you never believed in. Something horrifying shows before you, it is in silhouette as the lightning strikes behind it. The frayed edges of the being follows a shape you do not comprehend, nor do you wish to. In it you see no being, no entity. You see the bloodied remains of Tesh, of Scara, of Wilhelm. You see not their entrails spilling out them, but the implication of their death, with Tesh, the loss that comes with the death of the last of her kind. With Scara, the last chance to save the innocence you held in a time now permanently lost. With Wilhelm, the sensation of a nosedive that comes with losing that support that you considered would never leave you. An age passes in the snap of a lightningbolt, as the room goes dark. Power returns to the building and the entity is gone.*

Lozano is now heavily shaken, not being able to comprehend what happens around him, not being able to cast spells normally. The heroes ask what happened by Lozano is not able to respond. Tarrok shares with the heroes that he got a new assignement which states that the target was last seen in the Foul Cathedral on the second floor. That place is not safe anymore. Second to that he also shows another assignment, he is to return Woof N'one, Meow his old dog... For now they find a safe place first, in the city where Lozano tries to make a connection to Ketephys which succeeds, his God is there however does not respond when Lozano asks him what creature it was he saw. This gives Lozano an ominous feeling. Tarrok meets with Tlaaxu warning him of the entity he just felt. Lozano wakes up and they share their confrontation. For now they decide that they have to do anything to avoid this entity and the first task at hand is releasing the ankle bracelet. Tlaaxu brought the friend (Mortar the Durugar) that could help them with that. He is not able to remove the ankle bracelet but he can relieve it of his power, he does this to both Meow and Lozano. There is one difference however, the sigil of Agaduhl remains with Meow but changes into the sigil of a scythe for Lozano.

## Session 061: The Woof of Wall Street, Meow turns himself in a burning thunder tornado
Lozano uses greater detect magic on his anklet, it is still Abyssal in nature but he gets greater understanding of it. The ownership of the anklet has now been split by three parties: Agaduhl, Bane and a third unknown party. All of equal share, it would require a majority of votes to gain control of the wearer. Lozano thinks that the unknown party would by Mortar, since he is the one who tampered with the ankle bracelet. The third one is not the entity, the only thing Lozano knows is that it is someone from down here. With Meow the ownership is also shared by three parties: Agaduhl (49%), Bane and himself, so as long as they stay close together they have majority. Tarrok describes that he might know a way to get the heroes back to the material plane. It is a gladiator arena called the Blood Bowl, the slaves that win there win back their freedom, Tarrok however needs to find another way to get back. The heroes make way for the dog pound to save Woof, they head towards Wall Street. They enter the animal pound, the place is fully ransacked quite a long time ago. The heroes get an ominous feeling. The whole place is in shambles except for 5 drawers, Lozano and Tarrok urge caution to Meow. Meow uses caution on the first drawer which contains a bunch of paper. This makes Meow less cautious and he bluntly opens the second drawer causing an explosion which burns Meow. Tarrok tries to extinguish the fire by casting create water on him, however at the same time Meow decides to try and use a tornado blast to blast away the fire. This only causes a fire tornado and electrocution doing even more damage to Meow. After the heroes restored his health they read about Woof in the papers, it states he is on fire and has been placed in the back room. Next to that Tarrok reads that the dog pound has secretively been owned by the Bratva (Russian Mob) but they deemed it too dangerous and pulled out. They head through the barred door into the first dungeon of the Abyss: The Dog Pound. They enter a room with several cell blocks, which are abandoned. The back wall contains three sigils: an alpaca, an impala and an ant. They seem to be pressing buttons, after many tries the heroes use the combination Ant-Impala-Alpaca which opens the door to the back room. They hear a hissing sound coming from that same room. They enter the same kind of room however these cells are filled with all kinds of animals: velociraptors and dire wolverines. At the end of the room again are three sigils: Tiger, Bald Eagle, Camel the heroes don't know what the right answer is and incidentely trigger a cell to open freeing velociraptors.

## Session 062:
The velociraptors run out of the cage and are immediately hit by the trap set by Meow killing the majority of them. Lozano flees up in the air with his bow out while Bane kills three more with one swing of his scythe. In the mean time 3 velociraptor run into the stone sigils freeing 4 wolverines. They are quickly killed by both Lozano and Meow. They enter the next room, here they are standing on a stone slab which is filled with old blood and organs. Next to that the following tekst is written in Abyssal:

*Break the circle or break the binding, the howling one shall return, To those brave enough: First traverse each room and decipher its flaws before unleashing the howling one or die as fools. It can not see, it can not hear, it can not leave.*

Connected to the stone platform is a huge stone circle which has a pentagram on it with 5 burning candles. Connected to the stone circle by drawbridges are three floating rooms. These 3 floating rooms each wear a symbol:

1st room symbol: 2 crying theater masks

\- Bane enters the room, there are a lot of marble pillars, they go up to waist hight. Above it ivory helmets are floating in the shape of animal skulls. The room goes on and on and on, the pillar where Woof should be is empty. And it is the only empty one there is. Bane finds out that the helmets are torture devices which are created by the people above. These are helmets of maddening screams, victims will be deafened and can't be removed only destroyed. To test out how to destroy the helmet Bane hits one other helmet with his scythe.

2nd room symbol: large eye

\- This room is pitchblack in darkness, there is a beaming source of light and below it is a huge fountain. The floor is filled with gravel and gemstones. The same gemstones are lying on the bottom of the fountain, they are dull and have no magic. The gemstones on the ground however are very strong forces of demonic and celestial magic. Next to that they are burning with hot flames. When being extinguished by water they turn into the dull, magicless stones. The gemstones are Eyes of Praalor. Cursed gemstones that replace the eyes of its victim. It distorts one's vision and shows it a terrifying version of the world around it. Impossible to dispel and extremely difficult to destroy but the fire can be doused with water.

The heroes

Allan Farting went with Mortar into the pit where he was killed and later planted in the room of Bane.

## Session 063: Alex flies from Bonaire to play a full session to get information he already has
The heroes just spoke with a corpse (Mortar) who was hung in the room of Bane. The apartment was ransacked, and Bane used a spell speak with dead. We now know that Mortar went to the pit with a person names Alan Farting. Souls go to the pit to earn money, in this plane that is soul stones. Bane has never been to the pit before. Bane recieves a new case, the case Mortar. When Lozano searches the body it is clear that someone deliberately did this. The body is cruely slaughtered, the thorax is open and the heart is missing, at the place of the heart lie multiple soulstones. Lozano finds 2 letters on Mortar's body. A conversation between him and Alan Farting. Alan was looking for a 'bleeder' know in the lost art of splicing, if Mortar would find this person for him their debt would be settled. There is hasty handwriting below one of the laters containing a scribbled name: Gut Snarl. Desperate souls go to bleeders and offer them body parts, when the bleeder takes the organ he can change it into soul stones without turning the full body into one. So they split a piece of their soul in exchange for cash. Normally the one body part that can't be exchanged is the heart, still that is the case right now with mortar. There is one sick bleeder named Gut Snarl, the scribbled name on the letters found on the body of Mortar. Bane and Meow search the apartment, Bane feels that something is off, apart from the fact that the place is ransacked. Tlaaxu enters and tells the heroes Mortar was a demon, that is why his body is still present. He also tells them that he is a bleeder as well and that Gut Snarl is frowned upon because he does not hold the same ethical standars by also bleeding internal organs, something that ethical bleeders don't do. The last time Tlaaxu saw Gut Snarl he saw him carrying a chainsaw, and he was in the pit. The blood bowl is a fight in the pit that if you win it your soul is freed. The entrance fee for the blood bowl however costs a lot of soulstones. Tlaxuu guesses that Gut Snarl is sitting on a giant amount of soulsstones since he likes the art of bleeding but does not spend much. The idea arrises that the heroes want to initiate a heist to rob Gut Snarl of his money. The heroes make way for the pit, expecting Gut Snarl to be there. Bane intimidates a beggar to find out where Gut Snarl is, he is probably to be found in the bottom of the sink hole, just follow the stink. The heroes make their way down and after a lengthy search find the hospital ward that Gut Snarl works in. He is holding a chainsaw who at this moment takes out a lung from a humanoid figure. Gut Snarl is a demonic creature with horns, long fingers and demonic nails. They start a conversation with him and find out that Alan Farting was interested in the art of splicing. Splicing is taking out an organ and replacing it with a demonic bodypart. Gut Snarl showed the art of splicing on the body of Mortar. During this procedure Alan Farting left and Gut Snarl claims to have fully transformed Mortar into a demon, when he got to the heart the heart explodes and Mortar perished. When this happens Gut Snarl claims to have tossed out his body out of the window. Lozano strucks a deal with Gut Snarl to get all the money he wants in return for the liver of Bane. Because it goes nice with some fava beans and a nice chianti. The heroes return to the Foul Cathedral and discuss their next plan. At this moment they know that Alan Farting probably planted the body of Mortar in Bane's room, they plan to go after him first, complete Bane's contract and hope to find a shitload of money in his house to cover the entrance fee of the blood bowl. If they would not have enough money after this they plan to go after the stash of Gut Snarl afterwards. Tarrok wakes up Tlaaxu and gets acid in his face in return. Tlaaxu explains that Alan Farting is a soul, he was a human before coming here. Alan is to be found at the court house. Bane receives a last clue explaining that Alan Farting is a soul who is owned by the state.

## Session 064: The Hell's Demons Motorclub as incentive to derail the train and the session (Alternative: SuperSalmonella and the SideKip)
The heroes plan to make way for the proscutors office, this lies in Alsscappale. You need to either take the subway or know someone that can smuggle you into Wall Street. The plan is to find Alan Farting and find a mutually beneficial goal. Maybe he would be tempted to find his freedom in the Blood Bowl too. If he pays the entrance fee the heroes can fight for his freedom. The heroes decide that they want to discuss the best route with Tlaaxu first, Tarrok goes down but finds the bar completely empty which he has never seen before. He tries to find Tlaaxu in his room where he saw him a few minutes ago but the room is completely empty, all the furniture is gone and no people are in it. Tarrok warns his companions and they make way down into the bar, they find empty glasses and the whole bar is knocked over. Tarrok finds that there are traces to be found of illusion magic, not active right now. The heroes suspect that Tlaaxu is some kind of spy and that this bar was a ruse. The beautifully stained glasses now are forming the shape of a ripped open Mortar. The heroes think that it is an open invitation form Alan Farting to find him and decide that they have to take the subway. Lozano gets an eerie feeling that the eyes of the Mortar stained glass acted as a vacuum drawing his soul towards it. He shakes it off and directs the heroes that they have to leave! Tarrok thinks that Lozano believes what he saw but he thinks his insanity takes over and grabs him and casts calm emotion on him, Meow can't prevent it from happening. Lozano has a temporary boost in sanity but still thinks that the enity has a grasp on him and tells the same story about the stained window. Tarrok has a feeling that maybe some shady figure in the underground has a way to heal Lozano his insanity. They had into the nearest underground station and buy 3 one way tickets to Alsscappale. The metro is empty at first but slowly people are getting in. The heroes take a look and it are demons dressed in motorcycle jackets yelling: WE GOT THEM BOYS, LET'S GET THEM! 20 red-skin orcs run at them with weapons drawn, Lozano summons 2 hyenas who rip apart an orc at the first moment. Tarrok slices down 4 orcs with his scythe en most of the others start running back to their lieutenant. At this moment one remaining orc tries to decouple the carts, Meow acts and tries to blow the orc away. To act as a counterweight Tarrok decides to enlarge himself by touching his pouldrons. However he gets so big that he splits the cart in half causing Lozano at the back to be decoupled, Lozano to crash on the railway en Meow having no counterweight blows himself away. The train derails and we will find out next Session if we are still alive.

## Session 065: Roll for penetration. Hey there's a rope hanging form the ceiling, I'll hang myself.
The heroes fly out of the metro hitting poisoned walls en electric tracks finally landing on the B-track. They face an Orc punk band called the Noise Boys! An insane fight starts which is heavily influenced by metros that rush by every six seconds. The heroes use every mode of transport they know to evade the passing metros en try to hack down the orcs in the mean time. In this they are helped by the stupidity of the orcs who remain standing on track resulting in them being squashed. After a time they get the hang of it, Lozano uses negative energy to kill 3 summoned wolves and Tarrok evaporizes an orc while being in is giant form. An interesting note about Tarrok touching his pouldrons and getting bigger or smaller: when returning to small size he feels an entity leaving his body, when growing large he feels an entity entering his body. Meow uses gusts of wind to try to hold orcs onto the track. In the end they only have one opponent left: Caleb, the drummer of the band. Caleb takes out a torch form his belt and lights it with a Zippo. He threatens to drop the torch on his drum kit of which Tarrok sees that it is filled with black powder and a black gooey substance. Tarrok decides to hack down the arm of Caleb, he succeeds but fails at the same time. The arm and torch fall down on the drum kit and it explodes. This kills Caleb and knocks down Tarrok. Tarrok gets completely covered up in the gooey stuff pinning him down to the ground making him helpless on the ground. With the metro now coming their way Lozano and Meow have to save Tarrok from the track. Lozano uses create water trying to dilute the gooey stuff but it only creates a pocket of water inside the gooey stuff. It does stretches the gooey stuff but doesn't break it. Tarrok now having a little more movement casts create water as well stretching the gooey stuff even more. The metro is now really closing in as Tarrok thinks of a brilliant move: he summons his scythe just before he loses consciousness. The scythe flies towards him piercing the bubble and the water flushes all 3 heroes towards the other track just in time for the metro to pass. Now fully drenched in water the heroes lie on a track that is about to be electrified. Meow uses gust of wind to blow away all the water and the heroes evade the upcoming metros. At this moment the hear a voice saying: "The Rat King applauds you and invites you in". At this moment a tunnel opens to their side and the metros stop going. The path is now open to head towards The Rat King. The walk through the tunnel until the find a small opening on the side where the see a golden rope going into the ceiling. It leads to a magical space in which a magical bonfire is lit and a tent is set up. They rest here for a short while. Tarrok explains the other 2 heroes that they are in the undersump, a sewer system connected to the river Styx. The demon lord of Sloth rules here called Jubelex. It does not feel like the Rat King is connected to Jubelex, probably he is ruling his own portion of the undersump. The heroes find out that the golden rope is a Rope of Fantastical Treehouse. Creating a magical campsite wherever they want.

## Session 066: Ringkeeper Bomb Squad
The heroes make their way through the tunnel, at the end they are stopped by a stacked pile of old train carts. Meow flies over, scouting ahead and sees a large room behind circled by old train carts. In the middel of the room is a pit, he summons the heroes. Lozano uses air walk to get over, Tarrok uses a rope but falls in the cart and finally makes his way through. Lozano and Meow see that the ground contains a lot of scorch marks around the crater and few humanoid skeletons. A huge magical fire bomb has erupted here. The humanoid skeletons are of 2 angels and 1 celestial (creature from Nirvana). Furthermore they find remains of a campsite. By touching the skeletos they hear their last thoughts: The angels: "We held on for too long" The celestial: "We came so far, and we lost due to a random mistake". The heroes make way to a locomotive that's in really bad shape, it is in really bad shape. They find a nirvanic ritual symbol on a socket that resembles the sun or light. After a few tries Meow electrocutes the socket doing nothing to the train. In the end they find a satchel hanging on the ceiling, it contains very powerful magic. Because the heroes are terrified of the contains they hide in the pocket dimension treehouse and Meow uses mage hand to open the bag. In the bag is a stone slab with a single nirvanic symbol, the same as the socket in the locomotive. Tarrok puts the slab in the socket and fires up the engine of the locomotive. The first time he holds it nearly too long and the energy spikes. Probably the angels hold it for too long and got scorched. They pace through the tunnel traced by rats and end in a new room. Tarrok gets the locomotive to an halt at exactly the right moment, it halts on a circular stone slab. It is a rotation stone which is connected to 10 train tracks al leading to a door. The most left door has the same sun symbol as before. A circular staircase circles down below the tracks and goes to 10 rat statues (the rat king itself). All the rat statues have a socket, one of them clearly has the sun symbol. They put in the stone and the circular stone with the locomotive on it turns and the track aligns with the Sun door. They find out the mechanic of the stone:

Runic fireball (X is seconds held): When the stone is activated by running a finger along the rune, it wil charge until the finger is removed from the stone. A fireblast will appear in a X\*5 feet cone, doing Xd6 damage. Reflex save 20 halves damage.

Tarrok opens the Sun door with the sun stone but by removing it the door closes again. They have to find out a way to and open the door and light up the locomotive.
