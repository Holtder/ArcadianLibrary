# Ouroboros

The evil cult led by the mysterious "Umbra", partaking in evil rituals with unknown origin or goal.

## Goal
Quicknote version:
- The sun was sacrificed to bind a lord of the abyss to Hogar the half-orc.
- This lord at the time was Gruumsh, Thanatotic Titan and lord of Uligor, the abyssal continent of Wrath.
- During this time, Gruumsh was at war with the Midnight Isles, the realm of lust, led by Nocticula. Due to her recent victory to Vyriavaxus, Nocticula had grown in strength significantly. It was only due to the defection of Salana, a high ranking succubus, that Gruumsh had the knowledge neccesary to fight on equal level. Salana became Gruumsh his concubine in the process.
- Due to Orcus's trickery, Gruumsh was bound to the material plane, fused with Hogar. Orcus took over Uligor and struck a ceasefire with Nocticula.
- Salana fled to the material plane to go into hiding, as her affiliation with Gruumsh made her a marked target for both parties in the war.
- Due to some reason she became mortal and mothered Lady Dusseaux, who later in her life would form a cult focused on rebirth and returning her lost lover, Boris Dusseaux. Who had become a silent soul as a demilich, Dusseaux' intention is to fuse Gruumsh to to his soul to reignite his fire.

## Argentus Blakely
After being killed by a shadow demon in the Cube. Argentus Blakely was basnished to the Abyss for his hedonic behaviour in life. He became an incubus at the midnight isles under Nocticula's rule. Unable to return to the material plane, he tried to search for a way out. Then came Salana, the wife of Gruumsh, with a trade offer. Argentus had to give all information he had on the binding ritual Gruumsh was the victim of and all of the knowledge he has of the old kingdom, in return, Argentus was free to roam the world.

As it turns out later, this wasn't an advisory role as Blakely expected, he became Ouroboros' lapdog, not only did he provide all that he knew, but Argentus had to kill as well. His material plane persona shares the name Argentus Blakely, but he now works at a local library.
