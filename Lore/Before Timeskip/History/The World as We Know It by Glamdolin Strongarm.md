This story begins after the world has ended. Darkfall destroyed the world as we know it, but Dwarves aren’t easily beaten. When the world went black, most Dwarves left in big numbers through the elf gates, not to return in 200 years to a new and dark world. Some of the Dwarves stayed and gathered in the deepest parts of the Dwarven tunnels, creating the first of the new Dwarven Clans, referred to as The Elder Clan, or more commonly known as Those Who Stayed or the Natives.

In the new world the Dwarves split into five different clans: The Clan of Firsts, the Smithies; The Clan of Seconds, the Stonemasons; The Clan of Thirds, the Soldiers; The Clan of Fourths, the Jewelers; and The Clan of Fifths, the Devouts. All clans occupied a mountain in the new world and tunnelled deep into the earth. Four of these impressive underground settlements remain in present day, mostly unbeknownst to the surface world.

In the year 400 AD (After Darkfall) the Clan of Thirds betrayed their kind by freeing an unspeakable evil from the deeps below. With a joint effort of the other four clans the evil was defeated and almost all of the Thirds were destroyed. There are stories of Thirds that fled into the deserts and joined the nomadic tribes, but no hard evidence has ever been found to support this.

After 600 AD the strict tight-knit clan societies started to mix and live in the human cities. In present day children take the clan name of the clan they have the most affinity with, instead of inheriting it from their parents. In practice this is often still the clan of one of their parents, since they often have inherited a strong affinity with one of the subjects. Although the taboo from marrying with a dwarf of another clan has been lifted, history and a long time of peace have sustained the taboo of being a Third, a soldier. Only small, often radical groups, have taken up the name.

## Glamdolin Strongarm

  

### Appearance 

Glamdolin is a Dwarf of normal length, with red hair and brown eyes. Wearing a white-blue woolen vest over a chain shirt and brown pants, he has a weathered adventurous appearance. The holy symbol on a chain around his neck reveals that he is a cleric of Irory. A leather belt with beautifully polished gemstones set in iron fittings is the highlight of his look. The gems are of different types, but all have the white glow of divine powers to them.

  

### Short 

Glamdolin Strongarm of the Fifths is a cleric of Irori. Born in the year 955 AD, married by 976 AD and alone again in 980 AD, he has led a hard life. He was born a Fourth, like his father and grandfather, but after his wife, Aline Hammerfist, succumbed to the horrible disease Mindfire, he changed clan. As a Fourth he was trained as cutter of magic crystals, a skill he uses frequently to this day. Unbeknownst to him he is of Third Heritage.

  

### Traits 

- **Traitorous nature:** Due to his Third Heritage, Glamdolin is susceptible to calls of the Dark Side. Being a priest of Irori, he can change alignment to Lawful Evil with little problems. If he changes to Lawful Neutral or Chaotic he must betray his deity, which would need a character rebuild. 

- **Gemcutting:** Being raised as a Fourth, Glamdolin is an expert gemcutter.

  

### Full story 

Year 979. Glamdolin looks up from his book, *“Maesterwork Crystals, a Study of Quality and Potency”*, right into the face of his lovely wife Aline. Lit by the light of the blue crystal in the middle of the tent, she seems even more beautiful, if that was even possible. 

“Let’s go to bed Glam,” Aline says, smiling brightly. 

“Five more minutes, please?” Glam answers with twinkling eyes. 

“Okay then.” Aline takes her bedroll and turns her face away from Glam and the crystal. 

  

Not even two minutes later Glam hears a quiet snore and he closes his book, touches the crystal, which stops it from emitting light. Only five more days till they reach their home, the mountain of the Clan of Fours. He falls asleep while walking the tunnels under the mountain in his mind. 

  

He wakes up to his wife whispering: “Glam I’m so cold.” He checks her forehead and finds it glowing hot. “Shht now, you’ve caught something nasty. I’ll fetch some water and willow bark.” He gets up and goes outside. This illness worries him. They are still in the middle of nowhere with little medical supplies. 

  

After two days Aline has lost the ability to speak. She just lays there, delirious visions taking over her mind. “I have to do something,” Glam mutters. He has still no idea as to what this illness is. He decides to leave most of his gear behind. “I’ll buy a new sodding tent,” he says, as he picks Aline up, and starts walking. 

  

The sun sets. Progress was slow. With this pace, it’ll be seven days till he reaches the mountain. He wraps Aline and himself in the only blanket he took with him, and watches the stars as he falls asleep. He wakes up, laying against a cold body. Aline is no more. 

  

Three days later Glamdolin reaches the mountain. He looks calm, but the lines of grief seem carved into his face. He walks past the guards, not even noticing them. He descends through the tunnels and halls, ignoring the beauty of the polished gemstones that define the home of the Clan of Fourths. Several dwarves, friends perhaps, see him pass, shocked, silent. 

  

Glamdolin reaches his destination: the church of Fourths. “Father,” he speaks softly. “Aline, my wife, has passed away.” The priest approaches, and he puts a hand on Glamdolin’s shoulder. “This is grave news. Come, my child,” he says, and leads Glamdolin to a chamber with a bed. Glamdolin lays down, and sleeps. He walked through day and night, without stopping, without looking back. 

  

Sixteen years later Glamdolin is no longer a Fourth. He has joined the Fifths, to become a healing priest of Irori.

## On the magic of Crystals 

  

After Darkfall and taking refuge in the elven world, a new way of spellcasting was introduced to the world: the magic of crystals. At first poorly understood, it is now one of the most intensely studied areas of the arcane. Because the world had no viable source of light after Darkfall, mages had started to look for a new way of lighting their path. This culminated into the research of crystals, as some crystals had the capacity to store certain types of magic. 

  

Much like wands and scrolls, crystals allow people to cast spells they do not even know. But the most interesting feature of these crystals was the fact that these crystals do not need to be magically sustained to continue their magical effect. 

  

Suddenly light sources became available for the general public. A mage would charge a crystal with a spell and then would ignite its effect. Afterwards anyone can take this crystal with them to reap the benefits of its magical effects. 

  

These crystals were used intensively for a few hundred years until the natural occurrence of these crystals began to falter. The shortage of crystals caused the Gem War running from 560 AD to 620 AD, until an unnamed jeweler created a way to artificially craft these crystals. A new time of magic had dawned and crystal use grew exponentially. 

  

As with natural spellcasting there are multiple types—or families—of crystal spellcasting. Each of them is associated with a crystal color and a matching aura. 

- **Primal:** Green to yellow crystals 
- **Arcane:** Blue to purple crystals 
- **Divine:** White crystals 
- **Demonic:** Black crystals 

Anyone trained in the usage of magic devices can use these crystals, even if their personal skill of the arcane is limited. This means magic is far more widespread than it was before Darkfall, since a competent mage can produce a fair amount of crystals per day. 

The chance of a failing crystal does increase if one does not possess sufficient arcane knowledge and if it is unknown to you what the spell in the crystal is. Also, each mage leaves their personal spell imprint on a crystal, making it easier for the creator of the crystal to use it.
