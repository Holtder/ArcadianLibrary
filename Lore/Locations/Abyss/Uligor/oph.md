Main area of the

One continuous wall of skyscrapers with no entrance or exit, only tinted windows.

Hoop demons die allemaal belangrijk doet, maar je komt er nooit achter wat ze doen
"Don´t worry about it"

#### Mills/factories - The Pit 
A steep valley in the center of town; cant be seen into from the outside due to the thick layer of factory smog hanging over it. All who enter need to make continious fortitude saves or get weakened condition
Slaves worked to the bone
Fun fact: everyone is free to leave, but are so downtrodden that they don´t realize it

Plek waar je naartoe gaat als je je misdraagt
Plek waar zielen die geen eigenaar hebben naartoe worden gestuurd
