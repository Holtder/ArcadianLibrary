## Profile
A minor but ancient tiefling house whose fortunes have dwindled over the last century. Once respected metallurgists and arcane smiths, the Embergraves were pushed into irrelevance when the God‑Queen centralized industry under the TRC and the capital’s foundries. Now they cling to authority in Gully Hill, ruling a coal village far beneath their former station.

Their sigil: **a burning coal held in a skeletal hand**.

# Family Members

## Lord Hieran Embergrave
**Race:** Tiefling  
**Age:** Late 50s  
**Public Face:** Gruff, dutiful, exhausted.  
**Private Truth:** Haunted by the knowledge that his house is dying.

**Overview:**  
Hieran was once a proud noble, but decades of TRC oversight and dwindling influence have worn him down. He drinks quietly at night, staring at old ledgers and letters from better times. He fears rebellion, fears the Queen’s displeasure, and fears his sons will inherit nothing but ashes.

**Secrets:**  
- He owes a significant debt to the TRC for “modernizing” the mines.  
- He believes something unnatural lurks in the deeper shafts but refuses to halt production.

## Ferdinant Embergrave
**Race:** Tiefling  
**Age:** 27  
**Public Face:** Stern, intelligent, loyal to the Queen.  
**Private Truth:** Resentful, ambitious, and quietly plotting a way out.

**Overview:**  
Ferdinant effectively runs the village. He handles quotas, guard rotations, and TRC correspondence. He is respected but not loved — villagers see him as the Queen’s man, not theirs. He believes the Embergraves must adapt or perish, and he is willing to make ruthless choices to ensure survival.

**Secrets:**  
- He has been corresponding with a TRC official about replacing his father as lord.  
- He suspects the inquisitor, Sister Halvine, is investigating the family.  
- He has a hidden fascination with the old Embergrave craft and experiments in secret.

## Mikhael Embergrave
**Race:** Tiefling  
**Age:** 22  
**Public Face:** Gentle, sickly, harmless.  
**Private Truth:** Far more perceptive than he appears.

**Overview:**  
Mikhael is beloved by villagers for his kindness but dismissed as weak by nobles. He spends his days sketching birds, reading poetry, and wandering the gully paths. His health is fragile, but his mind is sharp — he notices patterns others miss.

**Secrets:**  
- He has discovered strange, metallic feathers near the mines and keeps them hidden.  
- He knows Ferdinant is plotting against their father but says nothing.  
- He dreams of leaving Gully Hill entirely, though he fears the outside world.

## Priestess Veyra Embergrave
**Race:** Tiefling  
**Age:** 34  
**Public Face:** Devout, charismatic, unshakeable.  
**Private Truth:** Fanatical and power-hungry.

**Overview:**  
Veyra is Hieran’s cousin and the village’s spiritual authority. She sees herself as the God‑Queen’s chosen instrument in Gully Hill. Her sermons are fiery, her punishments harsh, and her influence growing. Many villagers fear her more than the guards.

**Secrets:**  
- She believes the Embergraves are destined for divine elevation — if they purge the village of “impurities.”  
- She is quietly gathering a loyal inner circle of zealots.  
- She suspects Mikhael has “heretical curiosities” and watches him closely.
