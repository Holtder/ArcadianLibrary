**Background:** The village and it's patron House are suffering as more and more miners are leaving town. Lord Embergrave only just loaned a significant sum from the state owned Tiressean Railway Company (TRC) to modernize the mines, but the coal veins grow smaller and smaller each day, rumors of a great evil being doesn't help either. A badly kept secret is that one day the TRC will come to claim it's due. It caused Lord Hieran to enforce longer working hours and even more dire working conditions. Unrest grows as the common folk feel their knees buckling under the pressing thumb of nobility.

**Main story:** The body of poor Mikhael Embergrave was found in the back of a cabbie carriage going into town, cut up to pieces to fit in the trunk. Jacob Monaghue, Ravenar Grime and Thaldin Swiftstrike were passengers of the carriage, and with no cabdriver in sight, they are the main suspects. 

**Whodunnit:** Mikhael was killed by Veyra Embergrave, who magically disguised herself as Ferdinant. Even though she knows the Ferdinant loves his little brother very much, she figured that no inhabitant of Gully Hill would doubt the stern heir of the Embergrave house would act to consolidate his power. It turns out that Veyra is secretly Hieran's eldest daughter, but he gave her off to the Church of the God Queen so his secondborn Ferdinant, would become his - male - heir. Veyra found this out later in life. Vindictive, she uses the powers she learned in the church to manipulate the town and the house into ruin. Her plans:
- Kill Mikhael
- Summon monsters and evils inside the mines to create unrest just after Heiran lent a large sum from the TRC
- Fake her own death to show that the family is targeted by the killer, causing any company potentially willing to work with the house to back out.
- Kill Ferdinant, to have Heiran see his legacy crumbling in front of him.
- Burn the Embergrave manor down with Heiran inside of it.
- Flee to the capital
