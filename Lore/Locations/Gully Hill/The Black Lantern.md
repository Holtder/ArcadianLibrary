## Description
> A low, wood-framed building with soot-stained walls and a sagging thatch roof. The inn’s namesake — a black iron lantern enchanted to burn eternally — hangs above the door, casting flickering shadows across the muddy street. Inside, the air is thick with coal smoke, ale, and the scent of fried root vegetables. The walls are lined with faded murals of the God-Queen’s descent, now obscured by grime and age. A central hearth burns low, surrounded by mismatched chairs and tables. The floorboards creak with every step, and the ceiling is low enough that taller patrons must duck.

The inn serves as the village’s social hub, a place where miners, guards, and travelers mingle uneasily. Rumors flow freely here, and the tension between loyalty to the Queen and resentment of the nobility simmers just beneath the surface.
