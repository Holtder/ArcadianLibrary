## Overview
The explorable part for this dungeon goes up until the elevator going downstairs. It will feature a few monsters

NOTE: the dungeon is smaller than the drawing due to time contraints

### A/C: entrance:
> As you enter the cave you notice that it's suprisingly well lit, several gems glowing a soft green hue mark the wall. The verdant shine colors the caverns in an uncomfortable, almost sterile pallor, as if the stone itself were scrubbed clean of anything living.

An appraisal check will reveal that the gems are generally worthless as they are very brittle and lose their shine one removed from the wall.

Walk on and the players enter the largest area of the dungeon, the working space. Several carts and tables fill the room, the tables are cluttered with small chisels, hammers, a helmet and several sketches of the lower mines. To the left, a door leads to the foreman's office. Up ahead is a staircase leading downwards.

As they are looking around, have them make a perception check to find a group of gremlins to fight (B2 142/143)
Gremlin, Jinkin x3
Gremlin, Nuglub x3

For later if the story has a need for it: have the east wall collaps revealing a natural cavern.
### B: Foremans office
Locked door, either bash it in or disable device DC 16. Once inside describe the room as you would expect the room to look like. A bit more tidy but still a room made from stone. Moving the table or chair makes an uncomfortable sound. EVerything has a thin layer of soot over it. 

### X: The Courteous Gentleman
The staircase goes down for a while until running into an interesting natural formation. An almost metallic mineral goes up from floor to ceiling, being as reflective as it is, it forms a giant mirror. It is obvious that the miners who ran into this did not want to disturb such a curious sight and dug around it, causing the staircase to make a hard left.

If the players find the clue in the final room, they'll find that if they say "After you", they'll find that their reflection will respond by "No, no, I insist!" and will take a step backwards, allowing the players to pass into the reflection. On the other side the players will find a small hideout, carved out by a small stream of clear water. It features a cot, a small bookcase with several readings on the God Queen and a small note, seemingly ripped out of a diary.

> I'll show that old man. I'll show him what could've been. Who was going to take over after him, Ferdinant? Please, that strung up bastard wants nothing but power, but wouldn't know what to do with it once he got it. That feeble idiot Mikhael? Please, he'd be wrung out withing a week. Hieran himself is growing old, he knows he's not for long, especially if the TRC comes cashing in their debts. The fool knows the walls are closing in, and his coffers are running dry. I don't even care about my inheritance anymore, who gives a crap about legacy. The God-Queen teaches us that we each have our humble place in life. To protect the great plan. Well how can the queen execute her great plan if the has such weak


### F: The Collapsed Support Chamber

A narrow chamber where wooden beams have snapped and fallen. Dust still hangs in the air and a faint draft blows from a crack in the stone. A broken pickaxe lies under rubble. A single boot, no foot inside. It cannot be passed easily as chunks of rock, beams and tools litter the room. Players can squeeze through, climb, or clear debris. It’s a moment of tension without combat, as they continue have them hear the sound of babbling water from where they came and skittering where they are going.

### Skip G

### H: Elevator room
Have them look around the room, which a a surprising amount of cobwebs. Several dead animals can be found and even one dead miner, looking pale with a green hue over their face. On the ground is scribbled/scratched. Shimmerstone - politeness is key. As soon as they read it, attack the players with the giant black widows.
