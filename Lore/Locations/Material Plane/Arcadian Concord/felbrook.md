# Felbrook

Felbrook, or Fel'Boorak, is a small coastal village southeast of the flying city of Arcadia. It is protected by a small extension ridge of the Dry Peaks as it lies at the Dancing Bay. This village is ran by the Druidic Circle of the Heiron, led by the Hierophant.

Fel'Boorak means Coarsing Emotion

## Tavern - The Will'o Wisp
> You see the Will'o Wisp, and it looks different from what you can remember. Yes, it is still a hut comprised of nearby foliage and plants, but a separate, normal looking hut has been built against it. Through the huts windows you see a few people sharing a drink.
The Will'o Wisp is an old sleeping hut that has recently added a tavern to the outside. It is owned by Cyran Valwynn and his granddaughter, Lura Valwynn. (See Felbrook &gt; NPCs)

### Clientèle
Mostly traveling druids that were willing to make a detour on their way to Lotaari. At the bar sits Fel'laru. Staying overnight is free.

### Statue of Pendlegast Frostmane
Pendlegast Frostmane was the first Hierophant to go up the nearby peaks, for the outside world only a week had passed but for Pendlegast it was two years. Somewhere up there he went into the feywild and learned lessons he would teach for years to come. Surprisingly the first druid of Felbrook was a human, even though the current population of Felbrook is mostly elven.

> **Description:**
> You see a tall statue, looking to be about 30 meters high. Its stonework and details seem to be slightly damages from the continual sea wind, but you can make out that whomever it is supposed to represent, he was a human. He is carrying a long staff. The statue is standing in a proud stance, extending his arm towards the sea while placing the staff down in front of him, as if he were splitting the wind.

> **Plaque:**
> Once the first Hierophant of Fel'Boorak, Pendlegast Frostmane is the only Hierophant we choose to remember by name. His pilgrimage up the hillside started a tradition that would last generations, giving rise to Fel'Boorak
