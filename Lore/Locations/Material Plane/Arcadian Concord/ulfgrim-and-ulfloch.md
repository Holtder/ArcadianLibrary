# Ulfgrim and Ulfloch

Ulfgrim is the name of the castle and Ulfloch is both the name of the village surrounding the castle and the adjacent lake.

## Tavern and Inn - The Sultry Hobgoblin
The Sultry Hobgoblin is owned by an unmarried human male named Donovan Frosten and his female elf friend Forsha Ellwyn. Donovan is a friendly and grandiose host that clearly has a passion for innkeeping and has no hidden secrets or unusual quirks, but Forsha is clearly involved in criminal activities. Donovan is an average looking with bronzed skin and light brown hair in a long, wavy style. Physically, he is certainly skinny. Forsha is a fair skinned elf with ashen hair cut short to a high bob. Before owning the tavern, Donovan worked there under his father, while the Forsha was born into poverty but scrambled enough money to buy into a tavern. The inspiration for the tavern's name was a story from Donovan's past where his mother seduced his father during a costume party wearing the most off putting outfit. It is a tavern of solid quality, and its main draw is its comfortable seating.

> You walk into the Sultry Hobgoblin and immediatly discern two types of patrons, the wary travelers that came from the South or Southeast and are on their way to Arcadia, they sit in merry groups and pass the evening as you would expect. Then there is the bar, which is filled from left to right with silent drinkers, solemnly drinking away their sorrows. Behind the bar stands a skinny, bronze skinned man with wavy light-brown hair. He is speaking to one of his patrons.

### Rumors
- Lord Hirm Graham is out for hunting as he often does, but never returns with any game or findings, he often laughs it off saying he was never a good hunter.
- Apparently the young lord likes a good riddle, sometimes he may stop in his tracks and ask a riddle, he wont respond to you before you answer it correctly.
- There are catacombs underneath the Ulfloch, but they have already been raided multiple times and nothing of value is to be attained there. If you want to get in you'll need the help of the ferryman at the docks.
- Lord Graham runs a large and glamorous court, yet the farms surrounding the castle are only enough to feed the people in the village.

## Ulfgrim Court
Lord Graham surrounds himself with three other members of the court and a only a handful of servants:

### Lord Graham
> Lord and master of the keep, Hirm Graham, a human male who looks around his late twenties, he has shoulder length dark brown hear, round black sunglasses in the shape of pince-nez and a mouth that never seems to fully close as he wears a continuous, teethy grin on his bearded face. On his head rests a small circlet adorned with small black jade stones. Out of the sleeves of his thick bear pelt robe stick two thin, milkwhite arms covered in runic tattoos. On his belt he wears a small rapier with the same black jade stones on the handle.
A playful young wizard with dark brown hair parted right in the middle; a bony white tint to his skin that almost seems translucent, a unkempt short beard and pince-nez shades with a golden rim. He never truly closes his lips completely showing off his pearly whites. He is of average height and lanky, wearing oversized robes made of bear fur. He likes puzzles and riddles and can at any time decide to halt the conversation to ask a riddle. He'll stubbornly wait until the correct answer is said before continuing on. Lord Graham has been a vampire for 10 years now, and is only now starting to expand on the possibilities of his immortality, before that he maintained a party boy lifestyle. Additionaly he is the descendant of Lord and Lady Dusseaux, he keeps this a secret even to his court.

> There are a lot of things in life that do not have a correct answer, puzzles do.

### The Advisor - Varesh Gordo

> As thin as he is tall, Varesh is a sharp faced elf with long thick black hair going down to his waist in a braid so tight it seems to stretch the skin on his forehead. His beady eyes dart across the room as tries to get an impression from all present guests. He wears a green tunic that drops to the floor, gold weavings lining the edges of the fabric.

Graham's direct advisor, a vampire himself and the one who turned Lord Graham, he has great plans for him and functions as his mentor. He has patience for his current lavish lifestyle as they have all the time they need. He is unaware of the young Lords heritage.

### The Dancer - Isabella Mork'eth

A sultry seducer and privy to more that even the rest of the court knows. Human from the valley of the five winds.

### The Mother - Petra Boral

An old dwarven lady that cares for her court, not an actual mother.

### The Musician - Remus Bloodsinger
