# The Free Cities

# Global notes

## Design Tenets
History of Free Lands, once ruled by Aristocratic slavers called the Jibun, after a revolution they were kicked out and now its every city for itself. Ruler differ from town to town. Some places have a "survival of the fittest" thing going on, some places have crime families at the top, some have elected officials, but no ruling government. The lands of the Free cities once were a sprawling forest, but due to Darkfall they withered away do a cold and barren landscape, all cities are coastal as through naval trade they were able to survive, as such all Qa'Hir are to some extent mercantile in nature.

## Locations
### The Five Free Cities or the Qa'hir (from west to east)
#### Nebebat - jewel of the west
Most western located of the free cities. Stronghold of the remaining Jibun. Despite the slave uprising during darkfall, it remains a political powerhouse due to it's location between Siressea to the west and the free cities to the east. It is the only city of the Qa'hir that still allows traditional slavery. Inhabitants of the other free cities refer to it as the Ko'hir, or 'False City'.

The four family houses of the Jibun are:
- The Ossa's, led by Harkon Ossa, an evil man hailing from Tashir
- The Sehyal, led by Reza Sehyal
- The Ishara, (arab for omen)
- The Ashraf (arab for honorable)

#### Baghu and Sikhara
Twin cities divided by a river; led by the Padishah Emperor of Baghsikh (who is a metallic dragon in disguise). It retains complete neutrality in all manners and houses refugees from all lands.

#### Sohad
A religious city, led by the califate of Srenra (the Sohadi name for Sarenrae). It was in this city where the original rebels that freed the slaves originated from.

#### Tashir
The Necropolis, the city of the undead. In the war for freedom these people decided that they still required a large workforce to gain profits. In this city undeath is not frowned upon. Each inhabitant is embalmed upon death and is turned into a well-preserved mummy. The living inhabitants are the workforce, working for the undead. It functions like a lot of other religions where the afterlife is supposed to be a reward for the work you've done in life. The city is led by a single Lich, Ishraq the Eternal (Ishraq meaning sunrise or radiant)

## Factions
### The Jibun
During the age of darkfall, the Jibun was a collection of twenty noble houses, four in each of the Qa'hir. They led the cities with an iron fist, thriving on the subjugation of thousands of slaves. Around 200 years before sunrine, a cult of Sarenrae (religion was outlawed for the slaves), guided the Sohadi slaves into an uprising, taking the city for themselves. They drove the Jibun out and set their sights on the other cities. In the end the surviving Jibun fled to Nebebat, where only four noble families remained to continue their course. They are ever at odds, continually scheming against each other. Secretly they are preparing for a house war.
> It is said that when the houses are not at odds anymore, albeit by peace or purge, Nebebat will be the birthplace of a new Jibun empire.
