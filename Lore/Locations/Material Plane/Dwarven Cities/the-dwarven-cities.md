# The Dwarven Cities

## Dhûgh Badir

An underground city found around the Rockdew Valley, a mountain pass straight through the Forgotten Mountains, East to Arcadia across the bay and northeast from the Ringkeep and the Archways.

### History

TODO: city of dwarves that remained. clan of thirds caused evil to be released. nowadays thirds are shunned, those that cast off the name become low class city guards, people that take on the name are often terrorists. These city guards are considered trash, as they both are descendants of the thirds and they abandoned their legacy. They are forced to guard worthless locations and have a black cross tattooed on their cheek as a sign of being a 'zero' or a 'clanless'.

### Divisions

The city is divised in five rings which go down and become smaller. A large pit is located beneath the lowest ring, which is filled with glowing creatures. In the middle of the pit is a tower which goes up to the ceiling. The tower seems to be made of different materials every few meters. On the ceiling is an upside down castle. There are bridges from all the ringsto the tower on their respective level. This is because the tower originally was the way to the mines when the city wasn't dug out yet.

#### First Ring - Clan of the Fifths, The Devouts

Closest to their gods, the Devouts spend their time on the top ring. You can find clergy who are followers of The Allfather Torag (North), The Warrior Son Trudd (West), The Inn's Mother Folgrit (East), and The General Angradd (South) here. These are found in church like buildings on each direction on the map.

#### Second Ring - Clan of the Fourths - The Jewelers

The top ring, the biggest one is of the jewelers, the fourth clan. The inhabitants of this caste are the most world-aware, as they bring in the money from the outside world. If you ask these jewelers, Arcadian Crystals are fine, but where Arcadia is the RnD department of magic, Dhûgh Badir is the well-oiled mass factory.

#### Third Ring - Commoners Quarters - The traders, travelers and shunned

All the entrances to the city end up here. This design is from the olden days when there still were thirds as the army, who were to protect the city from invaders. Nowadays the city doesn't shun traders, as long as they stay in this ring, together with the shunned thirds. Traders, Inns and the like can be found here.

#### Fourth Ring - Clan of the Seconds - The Stonemasons

Mostly living quarters and stone deposits, as the stonemasons build in the rest of the city. They seem to be preparing for something. They are waiting for the foundation of Dhûgh Hadun, a new city to be found by the four kings underneath the sun elf mountain Amaurëa. This suggests an impending war between the elves and the dwarves.

#### Fifth Ring - Clan of the First - The Smithees

#### Central pit - The grub pit, the home of the four kings and the mining tower
