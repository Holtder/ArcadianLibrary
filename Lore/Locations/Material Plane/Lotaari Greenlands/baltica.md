## History of Baltica

Before darkfall. a small tribe of Gnomes, the P'thumora used to live here and tend to the Moors. According to their religion, the Moors host one of the passages on to the afterlife. Without peace in the Moors, some may not be able to pass on to the next life. The P'thumora Settled to the south of the Moors and build a large wall of boulders to protect it from outsiders. You see, the rivers in the Moors are magical. Not only do they flow without a driving force, but moonlight reveals the faces of the dead, and some more attuned to the Moors may even commune with them. The P'thumora used the rivers to speak with their ancestors, but started to notice that their visions had started to blur. Only the rivers most deep inside the Moors were still clear. It had turned out a family of industrious halflings, the Druma, had set up to the west of Baltica, within the walls even! They used the magical waters for their watermills. At first the halflings and the gnomes coincided in peace, but the expansionist attitude of the Druma caused the rivers to become even more disturbed than before. Disruption of this peace caused conflict, and conflict caused bloodshed. During this civil war, the heir of the Druma family followed a P'thumoran into the Moors, with ill intent. It is there where he saw the gnome speak with one of his ancestors, who invited the halfling over. In the waters, the halfling spoke with many of the deceased, until he realised the true value of the Moors. At the end of the full-moon's night, the halfling and the gnome made a pact. The gnomes and the halflings would protect the Moors together, as well as keep it a secret for outsiders. With their influence, the conflict soon ended and a new time dawned. The Druma were allowed to build their watermills, as long as the owners of the millhouses would also become the protectors of the Moors.

Centuries later, Baltica has changed completely and hardly at all. The Druma and the P'thumora have mingled and more tribes and families joined the settlement. Few still know the secrets of the Moors but all that inhabit Baltica are strongly connected to these fields, still feeling that longing for peace, even if they don't know why anymore. To the west a small port was build where the Druma once originally arrived, from with only Baltica boats may settle. The Balticans import coarse wheat and resell it after milling it for a higher price.

Up until recently, the village was bustling with life and trade, several companies taking hold of their own mill, traders passing through from the port to the west, going through the central village, maybe stop at the Murkbay Inn, then pass on to the east where the Murks allow access to the road that leads to the Northern Blue Ocean.

Two years ago from the present, Baltica saw a horrible tragedy befall upon it, a murder spree of unknown origin had ravaged through the town, killing nearly all of the inhabitants. A path of water going from house to house up to the Hamuur residence, the engineers of the town. While most of the town saw bloodshed, the Hamuur residence was free of blood. In it lied a few bones, but not enough to account for all the residents.

## Areas
### Center village

To most considered to be "true Baltica", this is where most villagers live, they have a small market, tend to their gardens and mind their own business. The Balticans like their peace and will try often to maintain it. Often the only occurences the Balticans had to deal with were traders that tried to set up new trade routes. Ever since the incident however, this hasn't been the case anymore.

#### Buildings of interest

##### Market

Only two stalls mark the market:
- Vegetables: 
    - Ran by Beltran Mossrun, a male halfling. Looks young, dark curly hear, pitch black irises. A bit anxious at first towards new people but is a good judge of character and will loosen up if spoken to for longer periods. He is the son of the Mossrun family (see Mossrun Farm)
    - Sells: Root Vegetables
- Blacksmith: 
    - Ran by Isawyn, a green skinned gnome with white hair, which has dark streaks of soot through it from her smithing. She lives to the east at the smithee. She is hearty and open to strangers.
    - Sells: Farming tools, horseshoes for the ponies, materials for the mills.

##### Mossrun Farm

Ran by Surin and Ava Mossrun, two elderly halflings. Surin is a farmer through and through, very friendly and open to the people around him, even if they are strangers. Ava takes care of the animals around the farm and is a bit more anxious towards strangers.

##### Old Hamuur Residence
After the massacre, half of the remaining people in Baltica fled town. The other halve moved to the center of town so they did not have to live to far apart. The family that currently resides in it is is a gnomish family that moved in a half a year after the massacre:
- Calgrim Gallard; male gnome widower that takes care of his two children. His late wife was found at the stone gate after she died of blood loss. Apparently she cried out "it came from the river!" before she passed. He is a gray gnome with white hair, as he lost all his color when the massacre happened
- Children: Tixx and Moxx (male and female) gnome twins, both purple, after their mother. Rather mischievus

##### The Full Fox Inn
A huge tavern on one side of the road, royal sleeping quarters on the other. The Full Fox Inn was once made for travelers through Baltica and is the only building made for taller creatures. It is owned and ran by Dorabella Ghasten, a halfling woman who had turned to the bottle after the massacre. Her hair wild and red, once maybe fiery but now with a sloven and mute color palette.

### The Watermills
Three watermills are currently unowned, the third is owned by the last miller of Baltica:
- An old gnome woman named Hinto, who respects the water spirits and stops working during the week of a full moon. Old and batty, but with a deep understanding of the Moors.
