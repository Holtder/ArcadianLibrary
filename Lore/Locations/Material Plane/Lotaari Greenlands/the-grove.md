# The Grove

The Grove is a "city" with a population of about 400 inhabitants. This is the base of operations for the Guardians of the Forest. To the outside world little is known about this place, but to the inhabitants of the Lotaari forest, it is an integral structure of the green lands.

## Location

To the north of the coast of the Lotaari forest, a few miles into the sea, lies a circular formation of mountains. Inside this circle lies a forested valley with a gigantic, blue tree on the north end.

## Getting There

Somewhere in the Forest lies the Arbor of the Weeping Maiden, this section of the forest features an underground entrance, to some it will appear as ruins with complicated means to enter a cave, to others it will appear as the nest of a family of owlbears. Either way, the first time people arrive, a unique challenge is presented. Past the challenge lies a long tunnel, lines with the roots of the Mother Tree, glowing with blue veins of fey energy. This tunnel runs underneath the sea, which leads to the gates of The Grove.

## Layout

The grove is divided into two large sections. On the north end is a circular tree formation, inside it, the Mother Tree. South of this formation, surrounding it in a pincer like shape, lies the main area of The Grove.

Three towers dot the landscape, each belonging to one of the Treetenders.
