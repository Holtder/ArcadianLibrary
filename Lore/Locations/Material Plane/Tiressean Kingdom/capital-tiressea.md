# Capital - Tiressea

Tiressea is a walled off city divided into three districts, each walled off as well:

- The Golden District 
    - Lies on top of the western hill
    - The home of the nobles of Tiressea, covered in an antimagic field.
- Heartsford 
    - Central district and the slums of Tiressea
    - Often referred to as the valley
    - The antimagic fields don't reach here
- Aldorheim 
    - Built ontop and into the eastern hill of Tiressea
    - A keep so large the underlying mountain isn't even recognisable anymore
    - Also covered in an antimagic field
    - Protected by an elite guard called the Golden Guard.

The rest of Tiressea is guarded by the Blue Guard, men in full plate armor with blue lining.
